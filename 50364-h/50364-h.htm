    <div>Transcriber’s Note:</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Minor errors in punctuation and formatting have been silently
corrected. Please see the transcriber’s <a href='#endnote'>note</a> at the end of this
text for details regarding the handling of any textual issues
encountered during its preparation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Page headers signalled changes of topic, and have been retained
as paragraph descriptions (‘sidenotes’). Where the headers persist
across multiple pages, they were removed. On occasion, the headers
on facing pages are interleaved during an extended discussion of a
topic. Only the first of each were retained.</p>

<p class='c000'>The position of illustrations may have been adjusted slightly. The
page references to them in the Table of Contents are linked to the
actual position of each. Each plate is linked to a larger image

<p class='c000'>Captions for the Plates which appear within the images have been
repeated as text to facilitate searches. Where no captions were given,
or the images are composites (e.g. <a href='#p088b'>Plate III</a>), the
descriptions used in the Table of Contents were used.</p>

<p class='c000'>The alphabetic footnotes in the original restarted with ‘a’ and
cycled through the alphabet multiple times. Several notes to tables
used the typical asterisk and dagger symbols. All footnotes have been
re-sequenced numerically for uniqueness.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The famous Roman Wall, which, in former times,
protected southern Britain from the ravages of the
northern tribes, exhibits, at this day, remains more
entire, and forms a subject of study more interesting
than is generally supposed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two authors of great learning have treated of this
renowned structure—Horsley, in the Britannia
Romana, and Hodgson, in the last volume of his History
of Northumberland. Both are treatises of
considerable size, and both are, to a certain extent,
rare. The Britannia Romana, moreover, describes the
Wall, not as it is, but as it was more than a century
ago. Hodgson’s work is of recent date, and forms a
valuable storehouse of nearly all that is known upon
the subject. The mind, however, of that amiable
man and zealous antiquary was, at the time of its
preparation, bending under the weight of his ill-requited
labours, and he has failed to present his ample
materials to the reader in that condensed and well-arranged
form which distinguishes his previous volumes,
and without which a book on antiquities will
not arrest the attention of the general reader.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>The following work may be regarded as introductory
to the elaborate productions of Horsley and
Hodgson. The reader is not assumed to be acquainted
with the technicalities of archæology; and,
at each advancing step the information is supplied
which may render his course easy. I have not attempted,
in the last part of the work, to enumerate
all the altars and inscribed stones which have been
found upon the line of the Wall, but have made a
selection of those which are most likely to interest
the general reader, and to give him a correct idea of
the nature and value of these remains.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the body of the work I have endeavoured to
furnish a correct delineation of the present condition
of the Wall and its outworks. All my descriptions
are the result of personal observation. To secure
as great accuracy as possible, I have read over many
of my proof sheets on the spot which they describe.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pictorial illustrations have been prepared
with care, and will give the reader, who is not disposed
to traverse the ground, a correct idea of the
state of the Barrier. The wood-cuts and plates,
illustrative of the antiquities found on the line, have,
with the exception of a few coins introduced into
the first Part of the volume, and copied from
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='sc'>Monumenta Historica</span></span>, been prepared from
original drawings, taken for this work from the objects
themselves. I am not without hope that the
well-read antiquary will value these delineations for
their beauty and accuracy.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>The inhabitants of the isthmus are proud of the
Wall and its associations; and whatever may have
been the case with their forefathers, will not needlessly
destroy it. Most kind has been the reception
I have met with in my peregrinations, and
most valuable the assistance I have received from
the gentry and yeomen of the line, and others interested
in my labours! Gladly would I enumerate
all to whom I am indebted, had it been possible.
Some names, however, must be mentioned. His
Grace the Duke of Northumberland has not only
given me free access to all his antiquarian stores, but
directed me to prepare at his expense engravings on
wood of all that I thought suitable to my purpose.
Would that his Grace knew how much I have
been cheered in my course by his notice of my
humble labours! To John Clayton, esq., I am
obliged for the gift of the wood-cuts illustrative
of the numerous and interesting antiquities
preserved at <span class='sc'>Cilurnum</span>, the produce of that station
and <span class='sc'>Borcovicus</span>. To Albert Way, esq., the accomplished
and honorary secretary of the Archæological
Institute, with whom I had last year the
pleasure and advantage of spending a day upon
the Wall, I am indebted for the cuts representing
the altar and slab discovered at Tynemouth. The
suite of wood-cuts illustrative of the hoard of coins
found in the ancient quarry on Barcombe-hill,
have been engraved at the expense of my tried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>and valued friend, John Fenwick, esq., of Newcastle-upon-Tyne;
and to William Kell, esq.,
town-clerk of Gateshead, with whom I have traversed
the Wall from sea to sea, and some portions
of it repeatedly, I am indebted for the
beautiful representation of the ancient <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='sc'>Pons Ælii</span></span>
fronting the title-page. My former school-fellow,
William Woodman, esq., town-clerk of Morpeth,
besides otherwise assisting me, has caused surveys
to be made for my use of not fewer than eighty of
the strongholds of the Britons still existing on the
heights north of the Wall. To trace the movements
of the brave people whom the Romans drove to the
more inaccessible portions of the island, would have
been an interesting sequel to the account of the
Roman Wall, but I found the undertaking too great
for me.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is with no ordinary emotion that I write
the last lines of a work to the preparation of which
I have devoted the leisure of three years. The
Wall and I must now part company. Gladly
would I have withheld the publication of this
work for the Horatian period, and have spent the
interval in renewed investigations; though even
then I should have felt that I had fallen short of</p>

<a id='p001b'></a>IN no country of the world are there
such evident traces of the march
of Roman legions as in Britain.
In the northern parts of England
especially, the footprints of
the Empire are very distinct.
Northumberland, as Wallis long
ago remarked, is Roman ground.
Every other monument in Britain
yields in importance to <span class='sc'>The
Wall</span>. As this work, in grandeur
of conception, is worthy of the Mistress of Nations,
so, in durability of structure, is it the
becoming offspring of the Eternal City.</p>

<p class='c000'>A dead wall may seem to most a very unpromising
subject. The stones are indeed inanimate,
but he who has a head to think, and a heart
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>to feel, will find them suggestive of bright ideas and
melting sympathies; though dead themselves, they
will be the cause of mental life in him. A large part
of the knowledge which we possess of the early history
of our country has been dug out of the ground.
The spade and the plough of the rustic have often
exposed documents, which have revealed the movements,
as well as the modes of thought and feeling,
of those who have slept in the dust for centuries.
The casual wanderer by the relics of the Vallum and
the Wall, may not succeed in culling facts that are
new to the Historian, but he will probably get those
vivid glances into Roman character, and acquire that
personal interest in Roman story, which will give to
the prosaic records of chroniclers, a reality, and a
charm, which they did not before possess.</p>

<p class='c000'>As a natural introduction to the subject, and as a
means of preparing for some discussions which are
to follow, it may be well briefly to trace the progress
of the Roman arms in Britain, from the arrival of
Cæsar on our shores, to the eventual abandonment
of the island.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>EARLIEST NOTICES OF THE BRITISH ISLES.</div>

<p class='c000'>It is curious to observe, that the curtain of British
history is raised by some of the earliest and
greatest of profane writers. Herodotus, who wrote
about the year B.C. 450, mentions the "Cassiterides,
from which tin is procured"; Aristotle, about
the year B.C. 340, expressly names the islands of
Albion and Ierne; and Polybius, about the year
B.C. 160, makes a distinct reference to the "Britannic
Isles." To Julius Cæsar, however, we are indebted,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>for the first detailed account of Britain and its
inhabitants. On 26 Aug. B.C. 55, that renowned
conqueror landed in Britain, with a force of about ten
thousand men. Both on that occasion, and on a
second attempt, which, with a larger force, he made
the year following, he met with a warm reception
from the savage islanders. Tides and tempests
seconded the efforts of the natives, and great Julius
bade Britain a final farewell, without erecting any fortress
in it, or leaving any troops to secure his conquest.
Tacitus says, that he did not conquer Britain,
but only shewed it to the Romans. Horace, calling
upon Augustus to achieve the conquest, denominates
it 'untouched'—</p>

<div class='sidenote'>PLAUTIUS AND CLAUDIUS VISIT BRITAIN.</div>

<p class='c000'>During the reigns of Augustus, Tiberius, and Caligula,
Britain was unmolested by foreign invasion.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>At the invitation of a discontented Briton, Claudius
resolved to attempt the reduction of the island. In
the year of our Lord 43, he sent Aulus Plautius, with
four legions and their auxiliaries, amounting in all to
about fifty thousand men, into Britain. It was with
difficulty that the troops could be induced to engage
in the undertaking. They were unwilling, as
Dion Cassius informs us, "to engage in a war, as it
were, <em>out of the world</em>." The fears of the soldiery
were not without foundation. The Britons, though
their inferiors in discipline and arms, were not behind
them in valour and spirit, whilst, in a knowledge of
the country they had an important advantage.</p>

<div id='p004'  class='figright id006'>
<img src='images/i_p004.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>The year following, Claudius personally engaged
in the war. He advanced into the country, as far as
Camelodunum (Colchester), and after some sanguinary
contests, received the submission of the natives
in that vicinity. The estimation in which Britain,
even at this time, was held, was such, that the Senate,
on learning what he had achieved, surnamed him
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='sc'>Britannicus</span></span>, granted him a triumph, and voted him
annual games. The event was of sufficient importance,
to be celebrated on the current coin of the
day. Several gold and silver
pieces have come down to
our times, bearing on the
reverse, a triumphal arch,
on which is inscribed the
words <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='fss'>DE BRITANN</span></span><em>is</em>—Over the Britons. This
is the first occasion on which allusion is made to
Britain, on the coinage of Rome.</p>
<div class='sidenote'>ITS PARTIAL SUBJUGATION. BOADICEA.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>On the return of Claudius, the supreme command
again devolved upon his lieutenant, Aulus Plautius,
who succeeded in bringing into complete subjection,
the tribes occupying the southern portion of the
island. In this expedition, Vespasian, afterwards
emperor, acted as second in command to Plautius.
Titus, the son of Vespasian, accompanied his father.
Thus was it, in Britain, that the destroyers of Jerusalem
were unconsciously trained for inflicting upon
God’s chosen, but sinful people, the chastisements of
His displeasure.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ostorius Scapula, A.D. 50, succeeded to the command
in Britain. The brave Silures, headed by
Caractacus, rendered his progress slow and bloody.
Ostorius at length sank under the harassing nature
of his duties.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the reign of Nero, Roman affairs in Britain
received a severe check. The Iceni, led on by their
enraged queen Boadicea, threw off the yoke and
attacked the principal stations of the enemy. London,
which was then an important commercial city,
fell, upon the first assault, and Verulam (near the
modern St. Albans) shared the same fate. The British
warrior-queen sullied the splendour of her exploits
by her cruelty; seventy thousand Romans, or adherents
of the government of Rome, fell under her
hands. Suetonius, the Roman governor, collecting
his forces, gave battle to the queen and routed her.
A frightful carnage ensued; of the amazing number
of two hundred and thirty thousand men of which
the British forces are said to have consisted, not less
than eighty thousand fell.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>During the remainder of the reign of Nero, and
the short rule of his three successors, Galba, Otho,
and Vitellius, no advance was made in the conquest
of Britain. In the strifes of the rival emperors, it
was however destined to bear its part. Eight thousand
soldiers were drafted from it to fight under the
banners of Vitellius. Thus early, as Dr. Giles well
observes, was this island, whose position in the
bosom of the ocean indicates a peaceful policy, induced
to bear the brunt of continental quarrels.</p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>VESPASIAN ASSUMES THE PURPLE.</div>

<p class='c000'>When Vespasian assumed the purple, a new era
dawned upon the empire. This fact is well indicated
upon a coin struck at this period. In the engraving,
taken from a specimen found on the Wall,
the emperor is observed raising a prostrate female
from the ground (doubtless Rome), whilst Mars
looks approvingly on; the inspiring motto “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='sc'>Roma
Resurges</span></span>”—<em>Rome thou shalt rise again</em>,—encircles
the group.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c012'><sup>[2]</sup></a> Vespasian appointed Petilius Cerealis
his proprætor in Britain, who in five years succeeded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>in adding the Brigantes, a powerful tribe, to the
subjects of the empire. Julius Frontinus was his
successor, who, in the three years of his government,
nearly subdued the warlike nation of the Silures.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>HIS PROPRÆTORS SUBJUGATE THE ISLAND.</div>

<p class='c000'>One hundred and thirty-three years had now
elapsed since the first descent of Cæsar, and thirty-five
years, since Claudius had claimed the honour of
conquering Britain, and yet but a fraction of the
island was in subjection to Roman power. Nothing,
as Dr. Giles well remarks, can more strongly shew
the stubborn spirit of the natives, than their protracted
resistance to the invaders. Battle after battle
had been lost; but many of these tribes were still
unsubdued, and several even undiscovered.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE OPERATIONS OF AGRICOLA.</div>

<p class='c000'>But the reputation of all preceding governors, was
obscured by a greater man than they. Cnæus Julius
Agricola had served in Britain under some preceding
commanders; so that when he landed as
governor in the year 78 he was prepared to act with
all the promptitude which a knowledge of the country
and the people could give him. During the eight
years of his rule, he subjugated the remaining tribes
of southern Britain, carried his arms into the northern
section of the island, and drove, in successive
campaigns, the natives before him, until at length,
in the battle of the Grampians, he paralyzed their
strength for a while. He circumnavigated the whole
island, and planted the Roman standard upon the
Orkneys. He built walls and fortresses in all places
where they were required, and softened the fierceness
of the barbarians, by fostering a taste for letters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>and the luxuries of the Eternal City. But it is necessary
to trace the movements of Agricola, with some
of the detail with which they are given in the pages
of Tacitus.</p>

<p class='c014'>The summer of A.D. 78 was far spent when he arrived; yet
before going into winter quarters, he attacked and subdued
the Ordovices, and brought the sacred isle of Anglesea a
second time to obedience. The respite from arms which the
following winter afforded, was employed by the general in the
most useful and necessary purposes. Being well acquainted with
the temper of the inhabitants of the province, and having learnt
from the conduct and experience of others, that what is gained
by force avails little, where oppressions and grievances follow,
he determined to put an immediate end to all the causes of the
war. He began by checking and regulating the affairs of his
own household, correcting the abuses that had crept into the
army, promoting impartially those who deserved it; while at
the same time he redressed the grievances of the inhabitants,
made an equitable distribution of the public burthens, and
abolished all hurtful monopolies. By the prosecution of measures
so salutary as these, six months had scarcely elapsed,
when affairs in Britain were entirely changed, and assumed a
bright and settled aspect.</p>

<p class='c000'>His second campaign, that of the year 79, was
probably occupied in subduing the ancient tenants
of the <span class='sc'>Lower Isthmus</span> of the island.</p>

<p class='c014'>On the approach of summer, he re-assembled his army, and
in advancing, failed not to excite a proper spirit of emulation
among the troops, praising those who best observed their
several duties, and checking such as were remiss. He himself
chose the ground for encamping; the marshes, firths, and
difficult places, he always examined first; and, allowing the
enemy no respite, he continually harassed them with sudden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>incursions and ravages. Having alarmed and terrified them
sufficiently, he next tried the effect of good usage and the
allurements of peace. By this wise and prudent conduct,
several communities, which till then had maintained their independence,
submitted to the Romans, gave hostages, and
suffered garrisons and fortresses to be placed among them.
These strongholds he established with such judgment, as
effectually secured all those parts of Britain which had then
been visited by the Romans.</p>

<p class='c014'>The following winter was employed in civilizing and polishing
the rude inhabitants, who, living wild and dispersed over the
country, were thence ever restless and easily instigated to war.
At first, they were prevailed upon to associate more together,
and for this end were instructed in the art of building houses,
temples, and places of public resort. The sons of their chiefs
were taught the liberal sciences; hence it was no unusual
thing to see those who lately scorned the Roman language,
become admirers of its eloquence. By degrees, the customs,
manners, and dress of their conquerors, became familiar to
them, they acquired a taste for a life of inactivity and
ease, and at length were caught by the charms and incitements
of luxury and vice. By such as judged of things from
their external appearance only, all this was styled politeness
and humanity, while, in reality, Agricola was effectually enslaving
them, and imperceptibly rivetting their chains.</p>

<p class='c014'>During the third year of his command, he pushed his
conquests northwards, and carried his devastations as far
as the mouth of the Tay (<em>Taus</em>.) Here, the enemy were
struck with so much terror, that they durst not attack
the Roman army, though it was greatly distressed by the
severities of the climate. Agricola, in order to secure
possession of these advanced conquests, again erected forts
in the most commodious situations; and so judiciously was
this done, that none of them were ever taken by force, abandoned
through fear, or given up on terms of capitulation.
Each fort defended itself, and, against any long siege, was constantly
supplied with provisions for a year. Thus the several
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>garrisons not only passed the winter in perfect security,
but were likewise enabled, from these strongholds, to make
frequent excursions against the enemy, who could not, as heretofore,
repair the losses they had sustained in summer, by the
successes usually attending their winter expeditions.</p>

<p class='c000'>The forts here referred to, are probably those,
which were drawn along the <span class='sc'>Upper Isthmus</span> of the
island, extending from the Firth of Forth to the
Firth of Clyde, and which were afterwards connected
by the wall of Antoninus Pius.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is rendered apparent from what follows:—</p>

<p class='c014'>Agricola employed the fourth summer (A.D. 81) in settling
and further securing the country he had subdued. Here, had
it been compatible with the bravery of the army, or if the
glory of the Roman name would have permitted it, there
had been found a boundary to their conquests in Britain;
for the tide, entering from opposite seas, and flowing far into
the country by the rivers Glotta and Bodotria, their heads
are only separated by a narrow neck of land, which was occupied
by garrisons. Of all on this side, the Romans were already
masters, the enemy being driven, as it were, into another
island.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>AGRICOLA IS RECALLED.</div>

<p class='c000'>It is not necessary to pursue the operations of
Agricola further. In the seventh summer he defeated
Galgacus on the flanks of the Grampians.
The Roman power was now at its height. Agricola,
probably from motives of jealousy, was recalled by
the emperor Domitian, and as his successors were
not men of the same vigour as himself, the barbarians
were in a condition, at least to dispute the pretensions
of their conquerors.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>HADRIAN ARRIVES IN BRITAIN.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>In the year 120—thirty-five years after the recall
of Agricola—affairs in Britain had fallen into such
confusion, as to require the presence of the emperor
<span class='sc'>Hadrian</span>, who had assumed the imperial purple three
years before. He did not attempt to regain the conquests
which Agricola had made in Scotland, but
prudently sought to make the line of forts, which
that general had constructed in his second campaign,
the limit of his empire. With this object in view, he
drew a wall across the island—the <span class='sc'>Barrier</span> of the
<span class='sc'>Lower Isthmus</span>. The testimony of Spartian, the historian
of his reign, though brief, is decisive. Hadrian,
says he, visited Britain, when he corrected many
things, and first drew a wall (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>murus</em></span>) eighty miles
in length, to divide the barbarians from the Romans.</p>

<p class='c000'>The arrival in Britain, of Hadrian, one of Rome’s
greatest generals, was thought an event of sufficient
importance to be commemorated in the currency
of the empire. The large brass coin, here
represented, was struck by decree of the Senate in
the year 121.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c012'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE BARRIER OF THE UPPER ISTHMUS.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>The plans and the prowess of the emperor were
thought to have effectually secured those portions
of the island, which it was prudent to retain in
the grasp of Rome. This circumstance was announced
to the world in another coin, bearing, on the
reverse, a name destined to sound through regions
Hadrian never knew—<span class='sc'>Britannia</span>—and representing
a female figure seated on a rock, having a spear in
her left hand, and a shield by her side.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c012'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<div id='p012'  class='figcenter id008'>
<img src='images/i_p012.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>About twenty years after Hadrian’s expedition,
Lollius Urbicus took the command in Britain. He
was not satisfied with the limits which Hadrian had
prudently assigned to the empire in Britain. Forcing
back the Britons, he raised an earthen rampart
across the isthmus between the Forth and the Clyde.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Graham’s Dike, in Scotland, is the wall which was
built by Lollius Urbicus. This is proved by the numerous
sculptures which have, at different times,
been discovered among its ruins.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>DECLINE OF THE ROMAN POWER.</div>

<p class='c000'>The remaining history of the Romans, on the
northern frontier of England, is fraught with disaster.
The tide of war sometimes broke upon the northern,
and sometimes on the southern boundary; but its roar
and its devastation ceased not, until the Roman intruder
had been driven altogether from the island—or,
rather, until the successive strifes of Romans and
Picts, Normans and Saxons, Border reavers and
Scottish troopers, had been hushed, under the vigorous
rule of the last of the Tudors. What Hadrian
could not do, for the inhabitants of the North of England;
what Severus failed to accomplish; what the
great Alfred—the Norman oppressor—the Plantagenets—the
despotic Henry VIII., attempted in vain,
was accomplished under what John Knox calls ‘the
monstrous regiment of a woman.’ Then, a ‘bright
occidental star’ beamed upon these Northern Parts,
and Law began to assert its supremacy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Marcus Antoninus, who succeeded Antoninus
Pius, was far from enjoying the tranquillity which the
northern rampart was expected to give. He was
obliged to carry on very troublesome wars with the
Britons, and with much difficulty kept them in check.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE BRITONS PREVAIL.</div>

<p class='c000'>In the reign of Commodus, who became sole
emperor A.D. 180, the Britons, as we are told by
Xiphiline, who abridged the history of Dion, broke
through the wall which separated them from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>Roman province, killed the general, ruined the army,
and, in their ravages, carried everything before them.
The wall referred to, was probably that of the Lower
Isthmus; for, as Horsley conjectures, "the Caledonians
had broken through the wall of Antoninus Pius
not long after it was erected," and certain it is, "that
we meet with no inscriptions on the wall of Antoninus
but what belong to his reign."</p>

<p class='c000'>The circumstance, that the loathsome and ferocious
Commodus assumed the title of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='sc'>Britannicus</span></span>, is no
proof that success attended his arms. He was the
first person who had ascribed to him the conjoined
titles of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Pius</em></span> and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Felix</em></span>; but, as Lampridius satirically
observes, "When he had appointed the
adulterer of his mother a consul, he was called <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Pius</em></span>;
when he had slain Perennis, he was called <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Felix</em></span>; and
when the Britons were ready to choose another emperor,
he was flattered with the title of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='sc'>Britannicus</span></span>."</p>

<p class='c000'>During the time that Septimius Severus, Pescennius
Niger, and Clodius Albinus contended with each
other for the empire, the northern Britons were
held feebly in check. At length, A.D. 197, Severus
prevailed, and became sole master of the world.
Virius Lupus became his proprætor in Britain.
Unable to resist the attacks of the Caledonians in
the field, and having in vain attempted to purchase
their submission with money, his lieutenant sent
hasty letters to the emperor, entreating succour,
and, if possible, his presence.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is stated by Richard of Cirencester, that about
this time the <span class='sc'>Picts</span>, a tribe to which reference will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>presently be made, first landed in Scotland. The extraordinary
successes, as Dr. Giles remarks, which
the Caledonians gained, prior to the arrival of Severus,
confirm the supposition that they received considerable
reinforcements from abroad.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE ARRIVAL OF SEVERUS.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Severus</span> came at the call of his lieutenant. Both
Herodian and Xiphiline give us an account of the
proceedings of this renowned emperor in Britain,
and as their narratives are not only interesting in
themselves, but important in the investigation of
some subsequent questions, it will be well to
avail ourselves of their statements. Herodian
says—</p>

<p class='c014'>Whilst Severus was under a mighty concern about the
conduct of his two sons, he received letters from the governor
of Britain, informing him of the insurrections and inroads of
the barbarians, and the havoc they made far and near, and
begging, either a greater force, or that the emperor would
come over himself. Severus, for several reasons, was pleased
with the news, and, notwithstanding his age and infirmity,
resolved to go over in person. And though, by reason of the
gout upon him, he was forced to be carried in a litter, yet, he
entered upon the journey with a juvenile briskness and courage,
and performed it with great expedition. He quickly
crossed the sea, and as soon as he came upon the island, having
gathered a very great force together, he made ready for
war. The Britons, being alarmed and terrified, would fain
have excused themselves, and treated about peace. But
Severus, unwilling to lose his labour, or to miss the glory of
being called <span class='sc'>Britannicus</span>, dismissed their ambassadors, and
carried on his military preparations. Particularly, he took
care to make bridges or causeys through the marshes,
that the soldiers might travel and fight upon dry
ground.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>Herodian next gives a short description of the
inhabitants, and says that—</p>

<p class='c014'>Many parts of Britain were become fenny, by the frequent
inundations of the sea. The natives swim through those
fens, or run through them up to the waist in mud; for,
the greatest part of their bodies being naked, they regard
not the dirt. They wear iron about their necks and
bellies, esteeming this as fine and rich an ornament as
others do gold. They make upon their bodies the figures
of divers animals, and use no clothing, that they may
be exposed to view. They are a very bloody and warlike
people, using a little shield or target, and a spear. Their
sword hangs on their naked bodies. They know not the use
of a breastplate and helmet, and imagine these would be an
impediment to them in passing the fens. The air is always
thick with the vapours that ascend from these marshes.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE OPERATIONS OF SEVERUS.</div>

<p class='c000'>The historian proceeds with his story—</p>

<p class='c014'>Severus provided everything which might be of service to his
own people, and distress the enemy. And when all things were
in sufficient readiness, he left Geta, in that part of the island
which was subject to the Romans, to administer justice and
manage civil affairs, appointing some elderly friends to be his
assistants. His son Antoninus, better known by the name
of Caracalla, he took with him when he marched against the
barbarians. The Roman army passing the rivers and
trenches, which were the boundaries of the empire, skirmished
often in a tumultuous manner with the barbarians,
and as often put them to flight. But it was easy for
them to escape and to hide themselves in the woods and fens,
being well acquainted with the country, whereas the Romans
laboured under the opposite disadvantages. By these means
the war was prolonged. Severus, being old and infirm, and
confined at home, would have committed the management of
the war to his son Antoninus. But he, neglecting the barbarians,
endeavoured to gain the Roman army, with a view to
the empire. During his father’s lingering sickness he endeavoured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>to prevail with the physicians and servants to despatch
him. At last Severus died, worn out with sorrow, more than
disease.</p>

<p class='c000'>It will be observed, that in this detailed account
of the proceedings of Severus in Britain, not the
least allusion is made to the construction of a wall.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE NARRATIVE OF DION CASSIUS.</div>

<p class='c000'>Dion Cassius was contemporary with Severus.
That portion of his work which narrates the transactions
of this emperor in Britain, is unfortunately
lost, but an epitome of it, prepared by Xiphiline, remains.
From this abridgment the following extracts
are taken.</p>

<p class='c014'>Severus, observing that his two sons were abandoned to
their pleasures, and that the soldiers neglected their exercises,
undertook an expedition against Britain, though he was persuaded,
from his horoscope, that he never should return from
thence to Italy. Nor did he ever return from this expedition,
but died three years after he first set out from Rome. He got
a prodigious mass of riches in Britain. The two most considerable
bodies of the people in that island, and to which almost
all the rest relate, are the Caledonians and the Mæatæ.
The latter dwell near the barrier wall which separates the
island into two parts; the others live beyond them. Both
of them inhabit barren uncultivated mountains, or desert
marshy plains, where they have neither walls nor towns, nor
manured lands, but feed upon the milk of their flocks, upon
what they get by hunting, and some wild fruits.</p>

<p class='c000'>The mode in which he speaks of the Wall, in this
passage, implies its existence at the time of the arrival
of Severus. The historian, after giving an interesting
account of the manners of the inhabitants,
proceeds:—</p>

<p class='c014'>We are masters of little less than half the island. Severus,
having undertaken to reduce the whole under his subjection,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>entered into Caledonia, where he had endless fatigues to sustain,
forests to cut down, mountains to level, morasses to dry
up, and bridges to build. He had no battle to fight, and saw
no enemies in a body; instead of appearing, they exposed their
flocks of sheep and oxen, with design to surprise our soldiers
that should straggle from the army for the sake of plunder.
The waters, too, extremely incommoded our troops, insomuch
that some of our soldiers being able to march no farther, begged
of their companions to kill them, that they might not fall
alive into their enemies’ hands. In a word, Severus lost fifty
thousand men there, and yet quitted not his enterprise. He
went to the extremity of the island, where he observed very exactly
the course of the sun in those parts, and the length of
the days and nights both in summer and winter. He was
carried all over the island in a close chair, by reason of his infirmities,
and made a treaty with the inhabitants, by which he
obliged them to relinquish part of their country to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The peace thus purchased, by the cession of the
northern portion of the island, was badly observed.
The inhabitants having taken up arms, contrary to
the faith of treaties, Severus commanded his soldiers
to enter their country, and to put all they met to the
sword. He is said to have signified his savage intention,
by quoting, from Homer, the lines which
Cowper thus translates:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE DEATH OF SEVERUS.</div>

<p class='c000'>But in the midst of his enterprise he was taken off
by a distemper, to which, it was said, Antoninus, by
his undutiful conduct, had very much contributed.
He died at York, Feb. 4th, A.D. 211.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>The coins of Severus record his victories. One
of them is represented beneath. On the obverse
is the laureated head of the ferocious African—on
the reverse are two winged victories, attaching
a buckler to a palm tree, at the foot of which
two captives mournfully sit. The legend, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='fss'>VICTORIAE
BRITTANNICAE</span></span>, declares who these captives
are. Times are changed! wide as ocean rolls,
the burden of Britannia’s song exultingly declares,
'Britons never will be slaves,'—and, better still,
Britain has long been actively engaged in rescuing
from chains the sable sons of that continent in which
Severus first drew breath.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another curious record of the wars of Severus is
found in the poems of Ossian. The <span class='sc'>Caracul</span>, son
of the ‘King of the World,’ in the dramatic piece
‘Comala,’ is supposed to be Caracalla.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Dersagrena.</span> These are the signs of Fingal’s death. The
King of shields is fallen! and <span class='sc'>Caracul</span> prevails.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Comala.</span> Ruin overtake thee, <span class='fss'>THOU KING OF THE WORLD</span>!
Few be thy steps to the grave; and let one virgin mourn thee!</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Melicoma.</span> What sound is that on Ardven? Who comes
like the strength of rivers, when their crowded waters glitter
to the moon?</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span><span class='sc'>Comala.</span> Who is it but the foe of Comala, <span class='fss'>THE SON OF
THE KING OF THE WORLD</span>! Ghost of Fingal! do thou from thy
cloud, direct Comala’s bow....</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Fingal.</span> Raise ye bards, the song! <span class='sc'>Caracul</span> has fled
from our arms along the fields of his pride.</p>

<p class='c000'>After the death of Severus, a long period elapsed,
in which the Roman historians observe a profound
silence respecting the affairs of Britain. Local records
and native historians supply but feebly the
deficiency. During the reign of Gallienus, which
extended from A.D. 260 to 268, a large number of
usurpers arose, who are commonly denominated the
Thirty Tyrants. Of these Lollianus, Victorianus,
Postumus, the two Tetrici, and Marius, are supposed
to have assumed the sovereignty in this island;
for their coins have been dug up more abundantly
here than elsewhere.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>BRITAIN REVOLTS.</div>

<p class='c000'>Diocletian commenced his reign in the year 284.
Though he was a man of energy and ability, the
care of a crumbling empire was too much for him,
and he divided his honours and anxieties with Maximian.
Increasing perplexities a few years afterwards
induced the emperors to appoint two Cæsars.
Diocletian chose Galerius Maximianus, and Maximian
nominated Constantius Chlorus. To Constantius
was assigned the charge of Britain, where
he eventually found a grave. He was the father of
Constantine the Great.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>CARAUSIUS ATTAINS THE SOVEREIGNTY.</div>

<p class='c000'>During a portion of the united reign of Diocletian
and Maximian, Britain assumed an independent position.
In order to repress, in the northern seas, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>ravages of the Franks and Saxons, who about this
period began to demand a place in the world’s history,
Carausius was appointed to the command of
‘the channel fleet.’ Gesoriacum, the modern Boulogne,
was his place of rendezvous. Carausius, who
was an expert seaman, exerted himself, at first, with
extraordinary success, against the pirates. Afterwards,
it was observed that he consulted his own
interest, rather than the public service. The emperors
resolved upon his destruction. Carausius,
stimulated by self-preservation, as well as ambition,
entered into an alliance with his former foes, the
Franks and Saxons, and declared himself emperor
of Britain. He was favourably received by the natives
of the island, and for seven years wielded the
sovereignty of his empire with vigour and ability.
He repelled the Mæatæ and the Caledonians, and
having subdued these tribes, attached them to his
interest. Nothing, observes Mr. Thackeray, can
more fully prove the maritime strength and resources
of Great Britain, under an able ruler, than
the fact, that Carausius for seven years bade defiance
to the Roman power; and at the end of that time
fell, not overcome by the imperial forces, but by
private treachery. Never before, nor until several
hundred years after this period, was the country
firmly united under the government of one sovereign.</p>

<p class='c000'>Constantius was preparing to invade Britain with
a fleet of a thousand ships, when Carausius was
murdered by Allectus, whom he had trusted as his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>dearest friend. For about three years the assassin
held, though with a less firm grasp, the power formerly
possessed by his victim.</p>

<div id='p022'  class='figcenter id009'>
<img src='images/i_p022.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<div class='sidenote'>THE SUCCESSES OF CARAUSIUS.</div>

<p class='c000'>A very numerous suite of coins commemorates
the successes of Carausius, and vindicates his claim
to a share in the empire of the world. Two coins
are represented here. On the reverse of one is
a galley, which indicates the chief source of his
strength, and on the reverse of the other is a lion
with a thunderbolt in its mouth, significative, not
only of the bold bearing which the ancient sea-king
assumed, but of that which his successors in modern
times have maintained.</p>

<p class='c000'>Carausius, according to Macpherson, is the <span class='sc'>Caros</span>
of Ossian. The following extract, upon this supposition,
contains a remarkable allusion to the Wall.</p>

<p class='c014'>Who comes towards my son, with the murmur of a song!
His staff is in his hand, his grey hair loose on the wind.
Surly joy lightens his face. He often looks back to <span class='sc'>Caros</span>.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is Ryno of Songs, he that went to view the foe. "What
does <span class='sc'>Caros, King of ships</span>?" said the son of the now mournful
Ossian; "spreads he the wings of his pride,<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c012'><sup>[5]</sup></a> bard of the
times of old?"</p>

<p class='c014'>"He spreads them, Oscar," replied the bard, "but it is
behind his <span class='fss'>GATHERED HEAP</span>. He looks over his <span class='fss'>STONES</span> with
fear. He beholds thee terrible, as the ghost of night, that
rolls the wave to his ships!"</p>
<div class='sidenote'>BRITAIN UNDER DIOCLETIAN AND SUCCESSORS.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>It would be improper to leave the reign of Diocletian
without remarking, that under it, the church
of Christ endured the last and most terrible of the
ten persecutions, which pagan Rome inflicted upon
the followers of the cross. Britain did not escape.
Alban and many others, as Gildas and Bede inform
us, were martyrs for the faith.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the withdrawal, in the year 305, of Diocletian
and Maximian from the cares of empire, Galerius
and Constantius became the rulers of the world.</p>

<p class='c000'>Constantine, afterwards surnamed the Great, was
proclaimed emperor, on the death of his father Constantius,
at York. After a protracted struggle with
several rivals, he became, A.D. 313, sole possessor
of the imperial power. He was the first Christian
Emperor, and, in token of his faith, inscribed the
monogram of the Redeemer upon his banner, and
his coin. The circumstances under which he adopted
this step are thus detailed—</p>

<p class='c014'>Constantine was in Gaul, and having heard of the opposition
of his rival, who was in possession of Rome, he immediately
crossed the Alps, and proceeded against him. When
near Verona, on his march, and meditating the difficulties of
his situation, he was roused from deep thought by a bright
light, which suddenly illumined the sky, and, looking up, he saw
the sun, which was in its meridian, surmounted by a cross of
fire, and beneath it this inscription, τουτῳ νικα—"<span class='fss'>IN THIS
CONQUER</span>." He immediately adopted the cross as his ensign,
and formed on the spot the celebrated Labarum, or
Christian standard, which was ever after substituted for the
Roman eagle. This, as Eusebius describes it, was a spear
crossed by an arrow, on which was suspended a velum, having
inscribed on it the monogram, <span class='xlarge'>☧</span> formed by the Greek letters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span><em>Chi</em> and <em>Rho</em>, the initials of the name of Christ. Under this
he marched forward, and rapidly triumphed over all his
enemies; and, struck with the preternatural warning he had
received, and its consequences, he now publicly embraced the
doctrines of that religion under whose banner he had conquered.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c012'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<div id='p024'  class='figcenter id010'>
<img src='images/i_p024.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>The monogram is well displayed on the reverse of
a coin of Magnentius,<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c012'><sup>[7]</sup></a> which is here represented. The
Alpha and Omega, which accompany the symbol, indicate
the faith of the emperor in the divinity of
Christ—‘the beginning and the ending, which is,
and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.’</p>

<p class='c000'>Constantine removed the imperial seat from Rome
to Constantinople.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>BRITAIN OVER-RUN BY THE PICTS.</div>

<p class='c000'>During the life-time of Constantine, Britain partook
of the civil tranquillity of the rest of the world;
but in the reign of his immediate successors, the
Picts and Scots renewed their incursions into the
lower province. This was not the only evil which
Roman Britain had to endure. Magnentius, a
native of the isle, entered into a contest with Constantius
II. for the empire of the world, and in support
of his claims, collected an army, (chiefly drawn
from Britain) with which he three times met his
foe. On the death of Magnentius, by his own
hands, in the year 353, his successful rival inflicted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>a bloody revenge upon the Britons for having supported
their countryman: meanwhile the Picts and
Scots harassed them, on the north, with redoubled fury.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THEODOSIUS REPAIRS THE WALL.</div>

<p class='c000'>Little is recorded of Britain in the reign of Julian
the Apostate. In the time of Jovian his successor,
the Picts, Saxons, and Scots, vexed it by increasing
calamities. Valentinian obtained the purple A.D.
364, when the state of the country was so alarming
as to require immediate attention. Even London
seems to have been menaced by the enemy, if it was
not actually in their hands. Theodosius, the ablest
general of his time, went to the assistance of the
Britons, drove the enemy before him, and recovered
the provincial cities and forts. He then repaired the
cities and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>prætenturæ</em></span> and erected some new forts.
Horsley thinks that the Wall in the North of England,
and the stations upon it, are the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>prætenturæ</em></span> referred to.</p>

<p class='c000'>Valentinian, having, in 367, united with himself
in the government of the empire, Gratian his son,
died, A.D. 375. Six days afterwards, his second
son, Valentinian II. was proclaimed his successor.
The two brothers reigned together, Theodosius the
Great presiding at the same time in the Eastern
provinces, until Gratian was killed A.D. 383. Four
years afterwards, Valentinian was robbed of the
purple by Maximus, but applied for assistance to
his eastern colleague, Theodosius, and once more
entered Rome with imperial dignity. The sovereignty
of Britain, Gaul, and Spain was, however,
still conceded, for the present, to Maximus, who
adopted Treves as the seat of his government.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE ISLAND DRAINED OF ITS YOUTH.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>In this struggle Britain suffered severely. Maximus,
having served in the island under the elder
Theodosius, was a favourite with the Romanized
Britons. They flocked to his standard in such
numbers that the island seemed drained of its youth.
More than a hundred thousand persons are said to
have accompanied him from Britain to the continent.</p>

<p class='c000'>The loss of the native soldiery was severely felt
in the North of England, where the ruthless barbarians
renewed their ravages without molestation.
The whole island, in the querulous language of its
first historian, Gildas,<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c012'><sup>[8]</sup></a> "Deprived of all her armed
soldiers and military bands, was left to her cruel tyrants,
deprived of the assistance of all her youth
who went with Maximus, and ignorant of the art of
war, she groaned in amazement for many years under
the cruelty of the Picts and Scots."</p>

<p class='c000'>Theodosius died A.D. 395. He left his dominions
to his sons Arcadius and Honorius, who permanently
divided them into the empires of the East and
West. In the early part of the reign of Honorius,
the province of Britain, by the prudence of the emperor’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>minister Stilicho, had comparative rest from
the incursions of the enemy. But when the Gothic
war diverted the attention of the government from
so remote a province, and the legions of Britain
were called away to defend the seat of the empire
from the attacks of Alaric, the troubles which before
distracted the province, were again called into
fearful operation. A spirit of disaffection and revolt
increased the evil. Marcus and Gratian were successively
declared emperors by the islanders, but
were both speedily murdered. Constantine was
next raised to the sovereignty, an honour for which
he was indebted to his name, not his rank or fitness
for the office. Instead of endeavouring to secure
the peace of Britain, he transported his army to
Gaul and made a successful stand against Honorius.
He was assassinated in the year 411.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>BRITAIN BECOMES INDEPENDENT.</div>

<p class='c000'>Whilst Honorius was struggling with the usurper
Constantine, he wrote letters to the cities of Britain,
conceding the independence of the island, and urging
them to adopt measures for their own government
and protection. The gift of liberty was to
them a fatal boon. Their implacable enemies, finding
that the military science of the Romans no longer
protected the south, rushed forth to invade the undefended
province. The natives, in despair, turned
to the still powerful name of Rome, and dispatched
messengers to entreat help from the emperor.—But
let Gildas ‘the wise,’ depict the closing scene of
ancient Britain’s history—</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE NARRATIVE OF GILDAS.</div>

<p class='c014'>The Britons, impatient at the assaults of their enemies,
send ambassadors to Rome, entreating, in piteous terms, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>assistance of an armed band to protect them. A legion is
immediately sent, provided sufficiently with arms. When
they had crossed over the sea, and landed, they came at once
to close conflict with their enemies, and slew great numbers
of them. All of them were driven beyond the borders, and
the humiliated natives rescued from the bloody slavery which
awaited them. By the advice of their protectors, they now
built a wall across the island, from one sea to the other, which,
being manned with a proper force, might be a terror to the
foes whom it was intended to repel, and a protection to their
friends whom it covered. But this wall being made of turf,
instead of stone, was of no use to that foolish people, who had
no head to guide them.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Roman legion had no sooner returned home in joy and
triumph, than their former foes, like hungry and ravening
wolves, rushing with greedy jaws upon the fold, which is left
without a shepherd, are wafted, both by the strength of oarsmen
and the blowing wind, break through the boundaries, and
spread slaughter on every side.</p>

<p class='c014'>And now again they send suppliant ambassadors, with their
garments rent, and their heads covered with ashes, imploring
assistance from the Romans, like timorous chickens crowding
under the protecting wings of their parents. Upon this, the
Romans, moved with compassion, send forward, like eagles in
their flight, their bands of cavalry and mariners, and planting
their terrible swords upon the shoulders of their enemies,
mow them down like leaves which fall at their destined period.
Having driven their enemies beyond the sea, the Romans left
the country, giving them notice, that they could no longer be
harassed by such laborious expeditions, but that the islanders,
inuring themselves to warlike weapons, should valiantly protect
their country, their property, their wives, and children;
that they should not suffer their hands to be tied behind their
backs, by a nation, which, unless they were enervated by idleness
and sloth, was not more powerful than themselves, but
that they should arm those hands with buckler, sword, and
spear, ready for the field of battle; and, because they thought
this also of advantage to the people they were about to leave,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>they, with the help of the miserable natives, built a wall,
different from the former, by public and private contributions,
and of the same structure as walls generally are, extending
in a straight line from sea to sea, between some cities, which,
from fear of their enemies, had then by chance been built.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE DISTRESSES OF THE BRITONS.</div>

<p class='c014'>No sooner were they gone, than the Picts and Scots, like
worms, which in the heat of mid-day, come forth from their
holes, hastily land from their canoes, differing one from
another in manners, but inspired with the same avidity for
blood, and all, more eager to shroud their villainous faces in
bushy hair, than to cover with decent clothing those parts of
their body which required it. Moreover, having heard of the
departure of our friends, and their resolution never to return,
they seized, with greater boldness than before, on all the country
towards the extreme north, as far as the Wall. To oppose
them, there was placed on the heights, a garrison, equally
slow to fight, and ill adapted to run away, a useless and
panic-struck company, which slumbered away days and nights
on their unprofitable watch. Meanwhile the hooked weapons
of their enemies were not idle, and our wretched countrymen
were dragged from the Wall, and dashed against the ground.
Such premature death, however, painful as it was, saved them
from seeing the miserable sufferings of their brothers and
children. But why should I say more? They left their cities,
abandoned the protection of the Wall, and dispersed themselves
in flight more desperately than before.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whilst the enemy butchered them like sheep, they
increased their own miseries by domestic feuds—</p>

<p class='c014'>They turned their arms upon each other, and for the sake
of a little sustenance, imbrued their hands in the blood of
their fellow countrymen.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again, in their distress, they applied to the Romans.
In the address, entitled ‘The Groans of the Britons,’
our author represents them as saying:—</p>

<p class='c014'>The barbarians drive us to the sea, the sea throws us back
on the barbarians: thus two modes of death await us, we are
either slain or drowned.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>The Romans could not assist them, and, unwilling
to assist themselves, they sought and obtained the
help of those ‘wolves’, as Gildas calls them, the
fierce and impious Saxons. The result is known
to all—Celtic Britain became Saxon England—and
England, with all its faults,—has it not been a blessing
to the world?</p>

<p class='c000'>The picture drawn by Gildas of the misery of the
southern Britons, and of the ravages of the northern
barbarians, is doubtless correct; but, in ascribing
the erection of the earthen rampart, and the stone
wall of the <span class='sc'>Lower Barrier</span> to the period of the departure
of the Romans, he probably leans upon the
erring traditions of his own times. His statement
is devoid of probability. A work so bold in its design,
so skilfully planned, and involving so much
labour in its execution, cannot have been the result
of the expiring energies of Rome in Britain. Its
very ruins bespeak the masculine vigour of Rome’s
maturity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides, if we receive the testimony of Gildas
upon this point, we must either suppose that several
walls have been drawn across the island, or we
must reject the assertions of those classical writers
who ascribe the works to Hadrian or Severus. The
former supposition cannot be maintained, for we
meet with no traces of more than one earthen vallum,
and one stone wall, in the region in question;
and with reference to the latter alternative, it is more
likely that Gildas should err in his dates, than that
Dion Cassius, and Herodian, and Spartian, should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>describe, as existing in their day, that which was not
to be for centuries.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE BRITONS SUPINE IN YIELDING TO THE PICTS.</div>

<p class='c000'>Another question will arise in the mind of the
thoughtful reader;—how was it that the Britons suffered
themselves to become so easy a prey to the
Picts and Scots? Roman civilization could not,
greatly at least, have enervated them. The cultivation
of the liberal arts removes from the minds
and manners of men their unsightly asperities, but it
brings out in bolder relief their more valuable qualities.
The vices of the Romans, when grafted upon
the previously polluted life of the Britons, would
indeed have a tendency to unman them, but why
should it have sunk them beneath the level of the
Romans themselves? We do not find, moreover, that
the Britons who fought in foreign parts were deficient
in courage.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE BRITONS HAD BREATHING-TIME.</div>

<p class='c000'>An acquaintance with Roman discipline, a knowledge
of the Roman art of war, ought to have given
them great advantages over their less civilized neighbours
on the north of the Wall, and enabled them
easily to have retained that great structure as a
boundary fence.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c012'><sup>[9]</sup></a> It is true that great numbers of
their youth had from time to time been drafted off
by successive emperors, to engage in foreign quarrels,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>and that thus the land was deprived of its natural defenders.
This accounts for a part of their distress,
but not all. In a rude state of society, every man
is a soldier, and it was an essential part of the policy
of Rome to inure every citizen to the practice of arms.
There surely would be men enough left to defend their
homes, their liberties, and lives! Besides, half a century
elapsed between the time when the Romans began
to leave Britain to its own resources, and their final
refusal of all succour. There was thus time enough
to have nurtured a whole generation of veterans;
and there was time enough—if the energy had been
in them—to have shaken off those feelings of dependence
upon Rome, which the presence of their
conquerors had fostered. The opportunity, however,
was lost; they entreated, and wept, and groaned—and
passed off the stage of this world’s history. How
are we adequately to account for this circumstance?
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>THE GENEALOGY OF THE PICTS AND SCOTS.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>This is not the place to discuss the genealogy of the
Picts, but if we adopt the theory of their Germanic
origin,<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c012'><sup>[10]</sup></a> the enigma, if not made quite plain, will appear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>less difficult than before. However great the
valour, and however estimable the other qualities of
the Celtic race, they did not possess the patience, the
perseverance, the capacity for united action, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>power of command, which characterized the Teutonic
tribes; hence they would fall before them in any
contest which required sustained exertion.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>THE TEUTONES SUPPLANT THE CELTS.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Gibbon’s
estimate of the character of the ancient Britons
is probably correct—‘The various tribes possessed
valour without conduct, and the love of freedom
without the spirit of union. They took up arms
with savage fierceness, they laid them down, or
turned them against each other with wild inconstancy;
and, while they fought singly, they were
successively subdued.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'>ANTAGONISM OF THE RACES.</div>

<p class='c000'>The Picts, without the artificial advantages which
the Romanized Britons possessed, doubtless had
the usual characteristics of the Gothic tribes. By
these they were enabled, in defiance of the desultory
attempts of the previous occupants of the soil, to
ravage the land, until, through the efforts of Vortigern,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>they were confronted with foes of their own
kith and kin. In our sister island, we unhappily witness,
though in a subdued form, much of that animosity
of race which led to the devastation and
bloodshed that Gildas deplores. When will Saxon
and Celt lay aside their differences, and unite
for the common weal of Britain! Why should they
regard each other with mutual suspicion? Why
should the one triumph, and the other sink into hopeless,
helpless despair? Creation groans—a prostrate
world looks to united Britain and its offshoots, for
that balm which may heal its woes—let it, strong
in the confidence and love of its various constituent
parts, faithfully fulfil its duty!</p>

<div class='sidenote c015'>THE ROMAN ESTIMATION OF BRITAIN.</div>

<p class='c000'>On reviewing this sketch of the proceedings of
Rome, in relation to this distant portion of her great

amount of attention which the Imperial City bestowed

<p class='c000'>—and yet Britain, which, according to these authorities,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>scarcely formed a portion of the habitable earth,
which was perpetually lashed by a stormy ocean,
and whose inhabitants, unlike many barbaric tribes,
were inhospitable to strangers, was the resort,
not only of numerous legionary and auxiliary
troops, but of very many of the emperors themselves.
Great Julius came. Claudius fought upon
our soil. Vespasian entered into conflict thirty-two
times with the southern Britons. Titus shared
in his toils and triumphs. Hadrian was here, and
left the impress of his mighty mind behind him.
Septimius Severus ended his days in Britain; his sons
Geta and Caracalla first assumed the purple in Britain.
The emperor Maximinus breathed, sixteen
centuries ago, the sea-borne gales of Tynemouth.
Britain, with its seas, was the chief scene of the exploits
of the emperor Carausius. Allectus reigned
three years over it. Constantius was long in the
island, and his son, Constantine the Great is said
to have first drawn breath upon our soil. Both Constans
and Magnentius were here. Theodosius the
Emperor fought under his father in Britain. Maximus,
who had previously married a British lady, was
invested by his soldiers with the purple at York—How
comes it that so many of those who boasted of
the mastery of this wide world, were induced personally
to visit this little isle?—how was it, but that</p>

<div class='sidenote'>ROME FORESHADOWS BRITAIN’S DESTINY.</div>

<p class='c000'>It seems as though there was an affinity between
England and Earth’s rulers—and that thus early it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>pointed out as the spot in which, of all others, save
one—Jerusalem—mankind had the greatest interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>The importance of Britain, in the estimation of
the Romans, is further shewn by the fact, that, of the
different coins struck by the imperial government in
the short period extending from the reign of Claudius
to that of Caracalla, at least fifty-six relate to this
country. Of these, two were struck in the reign of
Claudius, five in that of Hadrian, seventeen bear the
impress of Antonine, ten of Severus, twelve of
Caracalla, and ten of his brother Geta.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c012'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>CAUSE OF THE ROMAN OCCUPATION.</div>

<p class='c000'>Whilst however we maintain that Rome was led
to Britain by the impulse of a power of which she
was not conscious, and whilst we willingly acknowledge
that the conquest of Britain by the
Romans was the first of that series of signal providential
arrangements, by which, from the dawn of
history to the present hour, ‘the Governor among
the nations’ has prepared this island for performing
that important part in the drama of history, which
she now sustains,—the enquiry yet remains, by what
motive were the conquerors more immediately impelled
to settle in so remote an island? Such toils
would not have been endured, such sacrifices would
not have been made, victories over tribes so savage
would not thus have been gloried in, except the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>question ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cui bono</span>?’ could have been satisfactorily
answered. ‘I confess,’ says Horsley, 'that when I
view some part of the country in the north of England,
where the Romans had their military ways and stations,
that question naturally arises, which has been
often proposed: What could move them to march so
far to conquer such a country? It appears wild and
desolate enough at present, but must have been
more so at that time, from the accounts the Roman
historians have given us of it. I shall leave the
Caledonian Galgacus, or Tacitus for him, to return
the answer—If the enemy was rich, their covetousness
moved them; if poor, their ambition. And when
they added further desolation to a desolate country,
this was their peace.' Ambition was doubtless the
leading motive. From the earliest periods of Roman
history we find her bent upon conquest. Incessant
wars engendered a thirst for victory, and military
glory became the ruling passion of the people. The
wide grasp of their ambition gave to the features of
Roman character harder, but grander lineaments
than those which their more polished neighbours of
Greece possessed. Flattered, as the lords of the
world, by their favourite poets and historians, they
gloried in their proud pre-eminence, and thought that
they were but fulfilling their destiny in asserting a
claim to universal dominion. Candidates for public
favour knew well that to fan the popular passion was
the readiest way to succeed in their aims. None
understood this better than Julius Cæsar; and the
later emperors, who possessed not the power to strike
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>an energetic blow, found it necessary to maintain
the show at least of conquest and of triumph.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>WEALTH OF ANCIENT BRITAIN.</div>

<p class='c000'>Less worthy inducements were, however, not
wanting. There are few evils in the fibres of
whose roots the love of money will not be found.
Gold was another secret but powerful cause of the
hardships which the Romans themselves underwent,
and of the countless ills which they mercilessly
inflicted upon the miserable islanders. The
British chiefs in general appear to have had considerable
riches among them. Cæsar, according to
Strabo, acquired a large booty in his two descents
upon our shore. Prasutagus, the king of the Iceni,
died possessed of very great wealth. To a few
states in the south, and within a few years after
their first subjection, the philosophical Seneca lent
more than four hundred and eighty thousand pounds
of our money upon good security, and at exorbitant
interest.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c012'><sup>[12]</sup></a> Severus got a prodigious mass of riches
in this land. Gold is not now an article of mineral
wealth in Britain. We are not from this to infer
that it was not so when it was first invaded. The
precious metal is not met with in veins or strata, but is
diffused over the alluvial soil, or mixed with the sand
of rivers in grains or lumps. When the commercial
value of the glittering dust is discovered, it is
speedily picked up, and a country, once rich in it,
becomes, in the course of ages, impoverished. The
number of massive golden torques and armillæ of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>ancient Britons, which even yet are from time to time
being brought to light, favours the idea that the metal
was, in ancient days, tolerably abundant. Whatever
the secret motives, Cæsar came and conquered—</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE FATE OF ROME.</div>

<p class='c000'>In passing from the contemplation of the Roman
occupation of Britain to our examination of the remains
of the chief monument of imperial power
which time has left us, the mind will experience a
great transition. In the Wall, we have evident
traces of the might of Rome, but it is the might of
a giant laid prostrate—</p>

but startle, as he treads the deserted streets, or enters
the unbarred portals of <span class='sc'>Borcovicus</span>, and other

of Nations is now no more,<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c012'><sup>[13]</sup></a> and that the Eternal City
is buried in her own debris. The broken column,
the prostrate altar, ever and anon obtrude the fact
upon him. Another empire has sprung into being
of which Rome dreamt not. In a sense different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>from that which Virgil intended, the words in his
third Georgic are peculiarly striking—</p>

Numerous are the appellations
which the Great
Barrier of the Lower Isthmus
has obtained. 'It was
called by ancient writers
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>vallum barbaricum</em></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>prætentura</em></span>
and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>clusura</em></span>; by Dion

χωμα; by Antoninus and
others <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>vallum</em></span>; by some of
the Latin historians <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>murus</em></span>;
by the English the Picts’-wall, or <span class='sc'>the WALL</span>;
and by the Britons <i>gual Sever</i>, <i>gal Sever</i>, and
<i>mur Sever</i>. The names <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>prætentura</em></span> and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>clusura</em></span>
are given to it upon account of its being
stretched out against, and excluding the enemy.'
To the names thus enumerated by Camden,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>must be added, the Thirl Wall, the Kepe Wall,
and that by which it is best known at present, the
<span class='sc'>Roman Wall</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>GENERAL VIEW OF THE WORKS.</div>

<p class='c000'>This great fortification consists of three parts.</p>

<p class='c000'>I. A Stone Wall, strengthened by a ditch on its
northern side.</p>

<p class='c000'>II. A Turf Wall or Vallum, to the south of the
stone wall.</p>

<p class='c000'>III. Stations, Castles, Watch-towers, and Roads,
for the accommodation of the soldiery who manned
the Barrier, and for the transmission of military
stores. These lie, for the most part, between the
stone wall and the earthen rampart.</p>

<p class='c000'>The whole of the works proceed from one side of
the island to the other in a nearly direct line, and in
comparatively close companionship. The stone wall
and earthen rampart are generally within sixty or
seventy yards of each other.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c012'><sup>[14]</sup></a> The distance between
them, however, varies according to the nature of
the country. Sometimes they are so close as barely
to admit of the passage of the military way between
them, whilst, in one or two instances, they are upwards
of half-a-mile apart. It is in the high grounds
of the central region that they are most widely separated.
Midway between the seas, the country attains
a considerable elevation; here the stone wall seeks
the highest ridges, but the vallum, forsaking for a
while its usual companion, runs along the adjacent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>valley. Both works are, however, so arranged as
to afford each other the greatest amount of support
which the nature of the country allows.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>The stone wall extends from Wall’s-end on the
Tyne, to Bowness on the Solway, a space which
Horsley estimates at sixty-eight miles and three furlongs—the
turf wall falls short of this distance by about
three miles at each end, terminating at Newcastle
on the east side, and at Drumburgh on the west.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>GENERAL VIEW OF THE WORKS.</div>

<p class='c000'>The Map of the Wall, the more detailed Plans
of several parts of it in Plate II, and the Sections
given in a subsequent page, will afford a pretty correct
idea of the general arrangement of the works.</p>

<p class='c000'>Most writers who have treated of the Roman
remains in Britain, have considered that the two lines
of fortification are the works of different periods.
The earth-wall, or Vallum, has generally been ascribed
to Hadrian, but the stone wall, or Murus, to
Septimius Severus. This is the opinion of Horsley,
whose judgment is always deserving of the highest
consideration. Deferring to a subsequent period the
discussion of this question, it will be convenient,
meanwhile, to speak of the works as being but different
parts of one great engineering scheme.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE COURSE OF THE WALL.</div>

<p class='c000'>The most striking feature in the plan, both of the
Murus and the Vallum, is the determinate manner in
which they pursue their straight-forward course. The
Vallum makes fewer deviations from a right line than
the stone Wall; but as the Wall traverses higher
ground, this remarkable tendency is more easily detected
in it than in the other. Shooting over the country,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>in its onward course, it only swerves from a
straight line to take in its route the boldest elevations.
So far from declining a hill, it uniformly
selects it. For nineteen miles out of Newcastle, the
road to Carlisle runs upon the foundation of the
Wall, and during the summer months its dusty surface
contrasts well with the surrounding verdure.
Often will the traveller, after attaining some of the
steep acclivities of his path, observe the road stretching
for miles in an undeviating course to the east
and the west of him, resembling, as Hutton expresses
it, a white ribbon on a green ground. But if it never
moves from a right line, except to occupy the highest
points, it never fails to seize them, as they occur,
no matter how often it is compelled, with this view,
to change its direction. It never bends in a curve,
but always at an angle. Hence, along the craggy precipices
between Sewingshields and Thirlwall, it is
obliged to pursue a remarkably zig-zag course; for
it takes in its range, with the utmost pertinacity,
every projecting rock.</p>

<p class='c000'>This mode of proceeding involves another peculiarity.
It is compelled to accommodate itself to
the depressions of the mountainous region over
which it passes. Without flinching, it sinks into the
‘gap,’ or pass, which ever and anon occurs, and, having
crossed the narrow valley, ascends unfalteringly
the steep acclivity on the other side. The antiquary,
in following it into these ravines, is often compelled
to step with the utmost caution, and in clambering
up the opposite ascent, he is as frequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>constrained to pause for breath. After crossing the
river Irthing, in Cumberland, the Wall is opposed
in its course westward by a precipice of upwards of
one hundred feet in height. It cannot now be ascertained,
whether or not the Wall was taken up the edge
of this cliff, for the stratum is of a soft and yielding
nature, and is continually being removed by the
river below. Certain, however, it is, that the Wall,
accompanied by its ditch, is still to be seen on the very
brink of its summit. If it did not climb this steep,
it is the only one which, in the course of the line
from sea to sea, it refused—and if it did ascend it, it
would more nearly resemble a leaning tower than a
barrier wall.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE HEIGHT OF THE WALL.</div>

<p class='c000'>In no part of its course is the Wall entirely perfect,
and therefore it is difficult to ascertain what its
original height has been. Bede, whose cherished
home was the monastery of Jarrow, anciently part
of the parish of Wall’s-end, is the earliest author who
gives its dimensions. He says—‘It is eight feet in
breadth, and twelve in height, in a straight line from
east to west, as is still visible to beholders.’ Subsequent
writers assign to it a greater elevation. It
is not unlikely that the venerable monk, who was
no traveller, describes it as it existed in his own
neighbourhood; and we can readily conceive that in
a flat country, and upon the border of a navigable
river, it would, even then, have suffered more from
the hand of the spoiler than in the wilder regions
of the West.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a letter written by Sir Christopher Ridley, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>an account of the Wall as it stood about the year
1572. The writer says—</p>

<p class='c014'>Rycht worschipfull, where as you spake unto me for a
certayn knowledge of one wall builded betwyxt the Brittons
and Pightes (which we call the <span class='sc'>Kepe Wall</span>) builded by the
Pightes, sure theyr is one. The length whereof is about, I
think, almost a C myles, bilded alwayis whar they cold upon
the hyghtes, whereon about the greatest cragis was, and whare
theyr was no cragis or hy placis theyr was a great stank cast

to a town called the Wallis end besyd Tynemouth on the est
sea.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c012'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Samson Erdeswick, an English antiquary of some
celebrity, visited the Wall, in the year 1574.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c012'><sup>[16]</sup></a> His
account is here given—</p>

<p class='c014'>As towching Hadrian’s<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c012'><sup>[17]</sup></a> Wall, begyning abowt a town

the river syde estwards, they space of an eight myle by the

river of Eden; and then goeth straight estwards hard by a late
abbey called Lanvercost, and so crossing ower the mowntaynes
toward Newcastell.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE WIDTH OF THE WALL.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>Camden, who visited the Wall in 1599, says—</p>

<p class='c014'>Within two furlongs of Carvoran, on a pretty high hill the
Wall is still standing fifteen feet in height, and nine in
breadth.</p>

<p class='c000'>These statements leave upon the mind an impression
that the estimate of Bede is too low.</p>

<p class='c000'>In all probability, the Wall would be surmounted
by a battlement of not less than four feet in height,
and as this part of the structure would be the first to
fall into decay, Bede’s calculation was probably irrespective
of it. This, however, only gives us a total
elevation of sixteen feet. Unless we reject the
evidence of Ridley and Erdeswick, we must admit,
even after making due allowance for error and exaggeration,
that the Wall, when in its integrity, was
eighteen or nineteen feet high. This elevation
would be in keeping with its breadth.</p>

<p class='c000'>The thickness of the Wall varies considerably; in
some places it is six feet, in others nine feet and a
half.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c012'><sup>[18]</sup></a> Probably the prevailing width is eight feet,
the measurement given by Bede.</p>

<p class='c000'>The frequency with which the thickness of the
Wall varies, favours the idea that numerous gangs
of labourers were simultaneously employed upon the
work, and that each superintending centurion was allowed
to use his discretion as to its width. The northern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>face of the Wall is continuous, but the southern
has numerous outsets and insets measuring from
four to twelve inches, at the points, doubtless, where
the sections of the different companies joined.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE NORTH FOSSE.</div>

<p class='c000'>Throughout the whole of its length, the Wall is
accompanied on its northern margin by a broad and
deep <span class='sc'>Fosse</span>, which, by increasing the comparative
height of the Wall, would add greatly to its strength.
This portion of the Barrier may yet be traced, with
trifling interruptions, from sea to sea. Even in places
where the Wall has quite disappeared, its more lowly
companion, the fosse, remains. In some fertile
districts the plough has been carried over it in
vain; owing to the moisture of the site, the corn
sown upon it springs up with undue luxuriance,
and is almost uniformly laid prostrate before it can
ripen. From this circumstance the ground is frequently
retained in grass, while the neighbouring
parts are under tillage.<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c012'><sup>[19]</sup></a> The fosse thus more readily
catches the eye, and is likely longer to retain its
groove-like form than if subjected to the ordinary
process of cultivation.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the ditch traverses a flat or exposed country,
a portion of the materials taken out of it has frequently
been thrown upon its northern margin, so as
to present to the enemy an additional rampart. In
those positions, on the other hand, where its assistance
could be of no avail, as along the edge of a
cliff, the fosse does not appear.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>No small amount of labour has been expended in
the excavation of the ditch; it has been drawn indifferently
through alluvial soil, and rocks of sandstone,
limestone, and basalt. The patient exertion
which this involved is well seen on Tepper Moor,
where enormous blocks of whin lie just as they have
been lifted out of the fosse. The fosse never leaves
the Wall to avoid a mechanical difficulty.</p>

<p class='c000'>The size of the ditch in several places is still considerable.
To the east of Heddon-on-the-Wall, it
measures thirty four feet across the top, and is nearly
nine feet deep; as it descends the hill from Carvoran
to Thirlwall, it measures forty feet across the top,
fourteen across the bottom, and is ten feet deep.
Westward of Tepper Moor is a portion which, reckoning
from the top of the mound on its northern
margin, has a depth of twenty feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>The dimensions of the fosse were probably not
uniform throughout the line; but these examples prepare
us to receive, as tolerably correct, Hutton’s
estimate of its average size. ‘The ditch to the north,’
he says 'was as near as convenient, thirty-six feet
wide and fifteen feet deep.'<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c012'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The care with which the fosse was dressed, has
varied with the taste of the overseer and the forbearance
of the enemy. In some tracts, the work presents
as smooth and trim an aspect as a modern
railway cutting; in others, marks of haste, carelessness,
or sudden surprise, appear. The curious
circumstance which Hodgson describes in the following
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>paragraph may be seen in more than one
locality:—</p>

<p class='c014'>'A little west of Portgate, the appearance of the fosse is
still, to the eye that loves and understands antiquity, very
imposing and grand. The earth taken out of it lies spread
abroad to the north, in lines just as the workmen wheeled it
out and left it. The tracks of their barrows, with a slight
mound on each side remain unaltered in form.'<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c012'><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE VALLUM.</div>

<p class='c000'>The <span class='sc'>Vallum</span> or <span class='sc'>Turf Wall</span>, is uniformly to the
south of the stone Wall. It consists of three ramparts
and a fosse. One of these ramparts is placed
close upon the southern edge of the ditch, the two
others of larger dimensions<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c012'><sup>[22]</sup></a> stand, one to the north,
and the other to the south of it, at the distance of
about twenty-four feet. The annexed sections of
the works exhibit their present condition. They
are drawn to the scale of seventy-five feet to the
inch. The Wall is in these parts, unhappily,
entirely removed.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>The ramparts, in some parts of the line, stand, even
at present, six or seven feet above the level of the
neighbouring ground.<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c012'><sup>[23]</sup></a> They are composed of earth,
mingled, not unfrequently, with masses of stone. Occasionally,
the stone preponderates to such an extent
as to yield to the hand of the modern spoiler, ready
materials for the formation of stone dikes. In several
places they are being quarried with this view.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fosse of the Vallum is of a character similar to
the fosse of the stone Wall; but, judging from present
appearances, its dimensions have been rather
less. It, too, has been frequently cut through beds
of stone.</p>

<p class='c000'>The question will occasionally occur to the wanderer
by the Wall, whence were the materials obtained
for constructing the mounds of the Vallum?
With the exception of the fosse, there are no marks
of excavation in the neighbourhood, and that the
fosse of the Vallum would not yield materials sufficient
for the purpose, is abundantly evident.<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c012'><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>USE OF THE VALLUM.</div>

<p class='c000'>The contents of the ditch on the north of the
Wall have probably gone to assist in the formation
of these lines. This statement of course proceeds
upon the supposition that the Wall and the Vallum
were contemporaneous works. Upon the same assumption,
it may be added that the ramparts of the
Vallum are probably indebted for some portion of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>stone which they contain, to the chippings of the
Wall.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although the distance between the stone Wall and
the Vallum is, as already observed, perpetually varying,
the lines of the Vallum maintain amongst themselves
nearly the same relative position throughout
their entire course.</p>

<p class='c000'>No apparent paths of egress have been made
through these southern lines of fortification. The
only mode of communication with the country to
the south, originally contemplated, seems to have
been by the gateways of the stations.</p>

<p class='c000'>If we adopt the theory that the Wall and the Vallum
exhibit unity of design, a question of some importance
arises—With what view was the Vallum
constructed? Hodgson, with much probability,
conceives that, whilst the Wall undertook the harder
duty of warding off the professedly hostile tribes
of Caledonia, the Vallum was intended as a protection
against sudden surprise from the south. The
natives of the country on the south side of the Wall,
though conquered, were not to be depended upon;
in the event of their kinsmen in the north gaining an
advantage, they would be ready to avail themselves
of it. The Romans knew this, and with characteristic
prudence made themselves secure on both sides.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>PECULIAR CONSTRUCTION OF THE VALLUM.</div>

<p class='c000'>But, whatever we may conceive to have been the
design of the Vallum, the peculiarity of its form will
excite the attention of the enquirer, though probably
without his arriving at any satisfactory explanation.
Supposing, according to the common theory, that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>Vallum was an independent fortification, erected
long before the Wall, to resist a northern foe, why
was not the ditch, as in the case of the stone Wall,
drawn along the northern edge of the northern agger?
I cannot supply an answer. A similar difficulty meets
us on the supposition that it was meant to guard
against attack from the other side. Again, what part
did the smaller rampart on the south edge of the
fosse perform? Possibly it may have been intended
as a foot-hold for the soldiers when fighting on this
platform against the revolted Britons south of the
barrier.</p>

<p class='c000'>The third, and perhaps the most important, part of
the barrier line consisted of the structures that were
formed for the accommodation of the soldiery, and for
the ready transmission of troops and stores. Neither
stone walls, nor ditches, nor earthen ramparts,
would alone have proved material impediments to
the incursions of the Caledonians—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c005'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>An iron race, ...</div>
      <div class='line'>Foes to the gentler genius of the plain.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It is reported that Agesilaus, when asked where
were the walls of Sparta, pointed to his soldiers
and said, ‘There.’ The Romans placed their chief reliance
on the valour and discipline of their armies,
though they did not despise the assistance of mural
lines. In a foreign country, to which it was difficult
to transmit relays of troops, it became a matter of
great importance to economize the lives of the soldiery.
Hence arose the Wall.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>Those portions of the great barrier which yet
await our consideration, are the <span class='sc'>Stations</span>, the <span class='sc'>Mile-castles</span>,
the <span class='sc'>Turrets</span>, and the <span class='sc'>Roads</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE STATIONS.</div>

<p class='c000'>At distances along the line which average nearly
four miles, <span class='sc'>Stationary Camps</span> (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>stationes</em></span> or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>castra
stativa</em></span>) were erected. These received their distinctive
appellation, in contradistinction from those
temporary ramparts, which were thrown up when
an army halted for a night or for some brief period.</p>

<p class='c000'>The stations on the line of the Wall were military
cities, adapted for the residence of the chief
who commanded the district, and providing secure
lodgment for the powerful body of soldiery he had
under him. Here the commandant held his court;
hence issued decrees which none might gainsay;
here Roman arts, and literature, and luxury, struggled
for existence, when all around was ignorance
and barbarity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some of the stations, though connected with the
Wall, have evidently, as will afterwards be shewn,
been built before it: this does not prove that they
did not form part of the great design. To secure
a safe retreat for the soldiers employed upon the
work would necessarily be the first care of the
builder.</p>

<p class='c000'>The stations are uniformly quadrangular in their
shape, though somewhat rounded at the corners, and
contain an area of from three to five acres. A stone
wall, five feet thick, encloses them, and has probably
in every instance been strengthened by a fosse,
and one or more earthen ramparts. They usually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>stand upon ground which slopes to the south, and
are naturally defended upon one side at least.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE PLACE OF THE STATIONS.</div>

<p class='c000'>The Wall, when it does not fall in with the
northern wall of a station, usually comes up to the
northern cheek of its eastern and western gateways.
The Vallum, in like manner, usually approaches
close to the southern wall of the station, or comes up
to the defence of the southern side of the eastern
and western portals. Examples of these arrangements
are given in <a href='#p044b'>Plate II</a>. At least three of the
stations, it must, however, be observed, are quite
detached from both lines of fortification, being situated
to the south of them. They may have been
members of Agricola’s chain of forts.</p>

<p class='c000'>Probably all the stations have, on their erection,
been provided, after the usual method of Roman castrametation,
with four gateways; in several instances
one or more of these portals have been walled up at
an early period, in consequence, probably, of some
natural weakness in the situation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Narrow streets, intersecting each other at right
angles, occupy the interior of the stations, and
abundant ruins, outside the walls, indicate the fact that
extensive suburbs have, in every instance, been required
for the accommodation of the camp-followers.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE FERTILITY OF THE STATIONS.</div>

<p class='c000'>In selecting a spot for a station, care has been
taken that an abundant supply of water should
be at hand. The springs, rivulets, wells, and
aqueducts, whence they procured the needful fluid,
are still, in many places, to be traced; and never did
water more limpid, more sparkling, more invigorating,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>lave the lips of man, than that which flows from
these sources.</p>

<p class='c000'>For the most part, the stations—cities which for
centuries were the abodes of busy men, and which
resounded with the hum of multitudes, and the clash
of arms,—now present a scene of utter desolation.
The wayfarer may pass through them without knowing
it; the streets are levelled, the temples are overthrown,
and the sons and daughters of Italy, Mauritania,
and Spain, whose adopted homes they were,
no longer encounter him. The sheep, depasturing
the grass-grown ruins, look listlessly upon
the passer-by, and the curlew, wheeling above
his head, screams as at the presence of an intruder.
Whether, or not, sites naturally fertile were chosen
for the stations does not appear; but certain it
is, that they are now for the most part coated with
a sward more green and more luxuriant than that
which covers the contiguous grounds. Centuries of
occupation have given them a degree of fertility
which, probably, they will never lose.<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c012'><sup>[25]</sup></a> One can
scarcely turn up the soil without meeting, not only
with fragments of Roman pottery and other imperishable
articles, but with the bones of oxen, the tusks
of boars, the horns of deer, and other animal remains.
The debris of some of these cities is considered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>to be more valuable for farm purposes, than the
recent produce of the fold-yard, and is used as such.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE NAMES OF THE STATIONS.</div>

<p class='c000'>It is not a little remarkable that the names of the
stations, which must have been household words in
the days of Roman occupation, have for the most part
been obliterated from the local vocabulary; they are
now only to be recalled, and that with difficulty, by exhuming
the stony records of the past, and comparing
them with the notices of contemporaneous geographers.
The truth is, that military reasons dictated the
choice of the stations,—commercial facilities gave rise
to modern cities. Long may the mere military outpost
be consigned to the shepherd’s use, whilst the
wharf and the warehouse are beset by the busy
crowd!</p>

<p class='c000'>According to Horsley, the stations on the line of
the Wall, were eighteen in number, besides some
that were placed in its immediate vicinity, and lent
to it important aid. Hodgson, conceiving that
Horsley has in one instance mistaken a mere summer
fortification for a stationary camp, reduces the
number of stations on the line itself to seventeen.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE STATIONS ACCORDING TO THE NOTITIA.</div>

<p class='c000'>In ascertaining the number and the names of the
stations, a most valuable document has come down
to our times from the period of Roman occupation.
The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Notitia Imperii’</span> was probably written about the
end of the reign of Theodosius the younger, and was
certainly composed before the Romans abandoned
this island. It is a sort of list of the several military
and civil officers and magistrates both in the eastern
and western empires, with the places at which they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>were stationed. It may, in fact, be regarded as the
roll-call of the Roman army. The sixty-ninth
section of the work contains a list of the prefects
and tribunes under the command of the Honourable
the Duke of Britain. The portion of the section in
which we are at present interested is headed, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Item
per lineam valli</em></span>—Also along the line of the Wall—and
contains the following list:—</p>

  <ul class='c016'>

  </ul>

<div class='sidenote'>THE CORROBORATION OF LETTERED STONES.</div>

<p class='c000'>It is not said, nor does it appear, that all these
twenty-three stations were exactly upon the line of
the Wall itself. It is very plain indeed, says
Horsley, that according to the Notitia, <span class='sc'>Segedunum</span>
was the first, for that immediately follows the title
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>per lineam valli</em></span>; but he has not told us expressly
at what place or station they end.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c012'><sup>[28]</sup></a> Those stations
which were not on the Wall were probably in its
vicinity, and were connected with it by military
ways. The stations in this list are manifestly, as
this writer also observes, set down in some order, and
those that were near to each other are placed together;<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c012'><sup>[29]</sup></a>
so that if we ascertain the identity of some
of them, we may form a pretty correct estimate of the
position of the intermediate or neighbouring stations.</p>

<div id='p061'  class='figright id013'>
<img src='images/i_p061.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>When, in the ruins of a station, inscribed stones are
found bearing the name of a cohort mentioned in the
Notitia, the inference is natural, that, in most cases
at least, the imperial Notitia will furnish us with
a key to the ancient designation of the station. The
argument becomes irresistible, when, in several successive
instances the designations thus obtained correspond
exactly with the order of the places as given
in the Notitia. Let us
take an example. At
the station of Chesters,
on the North Tyne,
several slabs have been
found, bearing the
name of the second ala,
or wing, of the Astures.
One of these is here represented.<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c012'><sup>[30]</sup></a> It is a sepulchral
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>stone, and bears at the end of the third and the beginning
of the fourth lines the words—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c005'>

<img src='images/i_p062.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Now, as the Notitia represents this ala, or troop of
cavalry, to have been stationed at Cilurnum, the probability
is, that the camp on the west bank of the
North Tyne is the <span class='sc'>Cilurnum</span> of Roman Britain.</p>

<p class='c000'>Immediately following
‘The second wing of the
Astures at <span class='sc'>Cilurnum</span>,’ on
the Notitia list, is, ‘The
first cohort of the Batavians
at <span class='sc'>Procolitia</span>.’ Now the
station immediately west of
Chesters is Carrawburgh,
and here a slab and an altar
have been found, inscribed
with the name of this very
cohort. The woodcut represents
one of them,<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c012'><sup>[31]</sup></a> an altar to Fortune, which is

<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>the modern shepherd is the <span class='sc'>Borcovicus</span> of the
Roman hosts.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE FATE OF LETTERED STONES.</div>

<p class='c000'>In this way, the ancient designations of the stations
from <span class='sc'>Segedunum</span>, Wall’s-end, to <span class='sc'>Amboglanna</span>,
Birdoswald, have been accurately ascertained;
but no stony memorial of the past has arisen to confirm
the Notitia account of the stations westward
of this point. The peculiarly fertile nature of the
soil between the river Irthing and the Solway has
been inimical to the preservation of the Wall and
its antiquities. The wants of a numerous population
rendered stones of every kind valuable; and in an
ignorant age, when anything in the shape of a letter
was regarded as a thing of evil omen, those most
precious to the historian were the first to be sacrificed.<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c012'><sup>[33]</sup></a>
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>THE STATIONS WEST OF AMBOGLANNA.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Since the accuracy of the Notitia has been
confirmed in so many instances, it is but fair to
conclude, that it may be safely taken as a guide in
fixing the Roman designations of the remaining
stations along the line. Cambeck Fort is the station
next to Birdoswald; the Notitia places <span class='sc'>Petriana</span>
next in order to <span class='sc'>Amboglanna</span>, which has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>ascertained to be Birdoswald—doubtless, according
to this reasoning, Cambeck Fort is the ancient
<span class='sc'>Petriana</span>. In this way, could it be certainly ascertained
which were the stations <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>per lineam valli</em></span>,
each station might have its Roman name restored,
though not a syllable of the ancient designation be
retained in the modern cognomen. We should have
but to read over the roll-call, and let each camp in
succession answer to its name. Unhappily, there is
some doubt as to which are the stations along the
line of the Wall. Horsley conceives that Watch
Cross is the station next in order to Cambeck Fort,
and, accordingly, calls it <span class='sc'>Aballaba</span>; Stanwix, Burgh,
Drumburgh, and Bowness, he successively denominates,
after the Notitia, <span class='sc'>Congavata</span>, <span class='sc'>Axelodunum</span>,
<span class='sc'>Gabrosentis</span>, and <span class='sc'>Tunnocelum</span>. Subsequent inquirers,
and, in particular, the Rev. John Hodgson,
have seen reason to suspect that Watch Cross was
not a station <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>per lineam valli</em></span>. It probably was destitute
of stone walls, and was surrounded only by a
rampart of earth.<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c012'><sup>[34]</sup></a> It seems to have been a mere
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>castra æstiva</em></span>—a summer encampment, and consequently,
was not entitled to rank with those strongholds
that were intended to withstand all foes at all
seasons. Should Watch Cross be laid aside, the
whole of Horsley’s subsequent allocation of the
Notitia names is thrown out of course. It is much
to be desired that some ‘Witch Stone’ would start
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>from its hiding-place in the foundation of some cottage
or castle in the neighbourhood of any one of the
stations west of Cambeck Fort, and resolve the interesting
question. Until such an event does occur,
some doubt must hang upon the subject. The reader
will now understand how it is, that, according
to some authorities, the stations immediately dependent
upon the Wall are said to be eighteen in number,
and according to others only seventeen. For
the reason just referred to, the Notitia names of the
stations are not given on the Map of the Wall westward
of <span class='sc'>Petriana</span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The remainder of the stations of the Notitia were
probably out-posts, intended to give support to the
whole structure. The difficulty of rightly appropriating
the Notitia appellations to such of these as
have not yielded inscribed stones, is even greater
than in the case of those which follow more closely
the line of the Wall.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE EXTINCTION OF ROMAN NAMES.</div>

<p class='c000'>Before leaving this subject, the reader will do well
to compare the ancient with the modern names of the
stations, as far as they are ascertained; in doing
so, he will be struck with the almost total absence
of any similarity between them. So complete, it
would appear, has been the subversion by Pict, and
Saxon, and Dane, of the Roman domination in the
north of England, that the very names of the cities
which were occupied by the empire for centuries
have perished,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c005'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And, like this unsubstantial pageant faded,</div>
      <div class='line'>Leave not a rack behind.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'>THE CASTELLA OR MILE-CASTLES.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>In addition to the Stations, <span class='sc'>Castella</span> or <span class='sc'>Mile-Castles</span>
were provided for the use of the troops which
garrisoned the Wall. They derive their modern name
from the circumstance of their being usually placed at
the distance of a Roman mile from each other. They
were quadrangular buildings, differing somewhat in
size, but usually measuring from sixty to seventy feet
in each direction. With two exceptions, they have
been placed against the southern face of the Wall;
the castle at Portgate, every trace of which is now
obliterated, and another near <span class='sc'>Æsica</span>, the foundations
of which may, with some difficulty, still be traced,
seem to have projected equally to the north and
south of the Wall. Though generally placed
about seven furlongs from each other, the nature of
the ground, independently of distance, has frequently
determined the spot of their location. Whenever
the Wall has had occasion to traverse a river or a
mountain pass, a mile-castle has uniformly been
placed on the one side or other to guard the defile.
The mile-towers have generally had but one gate of
entrance, which was of very substantial masonry, and
was uniformly placed in the centre of the south wall;
the most perfect specimen now remaining, however,
has a northern, as well as a southern gateway. It
is not easy to conjecture what were the internal
arrangements of these buildings; probably they
afforded little accommodation beyond what their four
strong walls and well-barred gates gave. Hodgson
states that when the foundations of the castle northeast
of Housesteads were removed in 1832, the remains
of an inner wall were seen, all round, parallel to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>outer walls. He hence infers that the space between
the walls has been roofed, and the centre uncovered.
Deferring the further discussion of this subject until,
in the course of our local description, we arrive at
the most perfect specimen remaining—the mile-castle
near Cawfields—the reader is meanwhile referred
to the lithograph which depicts this interesting remain.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE TURRETS OR WATCH TOWERS.</div>

<p class='c000'>Between the mile-castles, four subsidiary buildings,
generally denominated <span class='sc'>Turrets</span> or <span class='sc'>Watch
Towers</span>, were placed. They were little more than
stone sentry-boxes. It is with much difficulty that
they can now be traced. Horsley, in his day, complained
that ‘scarce three of them could be made out
in succession.’ Would that the modern antiquary
could make the same lamentation! Scarcely one
along the whole line can with certainty be determined.
They contained an interior space of eight or ten
feet square. Horsley states the distance between
them to have been three hundred and eight yards—the
whole number would consequently be three
hundred and twenty. Though small buildings, they
were, like all the works of the Romans, built for perpetuity.
Hodgson found the walls of one near Birdoswald
to be nearly three feet thick. Such were the
buildings provided for the lodgement and security
of the cohorts, whose hard lot it was to guard this
frontier barrier. A plan of Cilurnum, and the works
in its vicinity, taken from Warburton’s Vallum
Romanum, in <a href='#p044b'>Plate II</a>., exhibits these arrangements,
and shews, as he remarks, how the Wall and the
Vallum, the stations, turrets, and castles, yielded
mutual assistance to each other.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE MILITARY WAY.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>But all these arrangements were not enough; without
<span class='sc'>Roads</span>, one important element in the strength of
the Great Barrier would have been wanting. Nothing
economizes military force more effectually than the possession
of means for quickly concentrating all available
resources upon any point that the enemy may
select for attack. The advance of Roman armies, and
the formation of roads, were uniformly contemporaneous.
The Barrier had its <span class='sc'>Military Way</span>. It is impossible
to over-estimate the importance of this part
of the works. Without it, all the rest would have been
useless. It would not, perhaps, be incorrect to say
that both Vallum and Wall were subsidiary to it,
and that the chief use of these structures was to
guard the road, and to protect and conceal from view,
both on the north and south, the troops that marched
along it. The modern history of the district traversed
by the Wall furnishes a singular corroboration
of this opinion. In the rebellion of 1715, the
operations of the royalist forces were greatly impeded
by the absence of a good road between Newcastle
and Carlisle. In the rebellion of 1745, a
similar inconvenience was experienced. Marshal
Wade was at Newcastle when the Pretender appeared
before the city of Carlisle. The commandant
of the city immediately sent an express to inform him
of his position. The general’s answer contained these
words:—</p>

<div class='c018'>Newcastle, November 10th, 1745, 7 o’clock.</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Gentlemen</span>,</p>

disappoint the Rebels of any design they may have formed

<div class='sidenote'>THE IMPORTANCE OF MILITARY ROADS.</div>

<p class='c000'>Thus, for want of a military road across the Isthmus,
the importance of which had been perceived by the
Romans sixteen centuries previously, the safety of
the kingdom was perilled, and a hostile force permitted
to pour itself into the heart of England.
After such terrible warnings, government at last
interfered, and an act of Parliament was passed
which set forth in the preamble:—</p>

<p class='c014'>Whereas the making and keeping a free and open communication
between the city of Carlisle and the town of Newcastle-upon-Tyne,
by a road for the passage of troops, horses,
and carriages, at all times of the year, would be of great use
and service to the public, and it hath been found by experience,
that the want of such road, passage, and communication, hath
been attended with great inconvenience and danger to this
kingdom. ....: Be it enacted, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c000'>The road now known in the district by the name
of the Military Road was accordingly made at the
public expense. It is not a little remarkable that
it takes precisely the track which the engineers of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>Rome had so many centuries before selected. In
the map of the Wall which accompanies this work,
the modern military road is delineated.</p>

<p class='c000'>The importance of a good road, protected by
military posts at short intervals, in securing the
tranquillity of a turbulent district, is strikingly shewn
in another instance. That part of the great highway
between Madrid and Cadiz which crosses the
wild hills of the Sierra barrier, was formerly left to
the robber and the wolf, without roads or villages.
A road, admirably planned, was at length executed by
Charles Le Maur, an able engineer in the service of
Charles III. The task of guarding it was the difficulty
next to be overcome. For this purpose, Spain,
who had colonized the new world, and expelled her
rich Jews and industrious Moors, was compelled to
resort to foreign assistance. In 1768, a colony of
Germans and Swiss settled upon the line on condition
of maintaining a constant guard.<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c012'><sup>[36]</sup></a> This is done
to the present day. Several consecutive towns, such
as Carolina, in Andalusia, are occupied by people
speaking nothing but the German language, and
regular patrols are constantly on the move from one
town to another. These Germans have their land in
better order and cultivation than the Spaniards.
This Spanish highway, with its stations at regular
intervals, with its foreign guards, who from generation
to generation maintain the tongue and the
habits of their fatherland, presents too many points
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>of resemblance to the manner in which the northern
frontier of Roman power in Britain was defended,
to be passed over without obtaining at least this
brief notice.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>MILITARY ROADS.</div>

<p class='c000'>Gordon, in his <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Itinerarium Septentrionale</span>, says,
that two military ways belonged to the Barrier; a
small Military Way a little to the south of the Wall,
and, beyond it, the Great Military Way. In addition
to these, Horsley enumerates a third, which he calls
the Old Military Way. Horsley conceives that the
north rampart of the Vallum constitutes the road
which was used by Agricola and Hadrian in transporting
their troops from station to station, and that when
Severus built the Wall, he formed a new road—the
great military way—which pursued an independent
course, sometimes coinciding with the old road,
but more frequently keeping nearer to the Wall.
That there may have been a path-way immediately
under the Wall which went from turret to turret, on
which the Roman sentries marched with slow and
measured pace, when they did not choose to expose
themselves upon the parapets of the Wall, is not
improbable; though we now look in vain for any
traces of it. But that the north agger of the Vallum
was thrown up either by Agricola or Hadrian to
serve the purposes of a road, is a proposition too
startling to be received even on the authority of the
learned Horsley. In some places, indeed, it is sufficiently
flattened to admit of the passage of traffic
along it, but in the greater part of the course where
the works of the Vallum are not under cultivation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>the rampart is too conical, too narrow, and too
ragged, to admit of such a use. Excepting in those
situations, where stones are mingled with the
whole mass of the agger, it exhibits no signs of
having been paved.<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c012'><sup>[37]</sup></a> The manner in which all the
ramparts of the Vallum on Tepper Moor are encumbered
with blocks of basalt, clearly shews, that here
at least there has been no road. Besides, few who
trace the lines of the Vallum from sea to sea, and
observe their complete parallelism, will be able to
resist the conclusion, that the whole of the works
were contemporaneous; whereas, Horsley’s theory
ascribes part to Agricola, and part to Hadrian:
moreover, it may be added, that so much do the
northern and the southernmost aggers resemble each
other, that unbiassed observers will scarcely entertain
a doubt, that they have been thrown up to
serve a precisely similar purpose.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE MILITARY WAY.</div>

<p class='c000'>Happily, there is no room for doubt respecting
the other road, which Horsley calls Severus’ Greater
Military Way, as in the untilled districts of the
country it may be traced for several consecutive
miles; and if we receive the theory, that the Murus
and Vallum are one work, there is no need to seek
for any other.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>CONSTRUCTION OF THE ROAD.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span><span class='sc'>The Military Way</span> is usually about seventeen
feet wide, and is composed of rubble so arranged as
to present a rounded surface, elevated in its centre
a foot or eighteen inches above the adjoining
ground. When carried along the slope of a hill, the
hanging side is made up by large kerb-stones. In
most places where it still remains, it is completely
grass-grown, but may, notwithstanding, be easily distinguished
from the neighbouring ground by the colour
of its herbage, the dryness of its substratum allowing
the growth of a finer description of plant. For the
same reason, a sheep-track generally runs along it.
For the accommodation of the soldiery, the road went
from castle to castle, and so, from station to station.
In doing this, it did not always keep close to the
Wall, but took the easiest path between the required
points. In traversing the precipitous grounds between
Sewingshields and Thirlwall, the ingenuity of
the engineer has been severely tried; but most successfully
has he performed his task. Whilst, as
previously observed, the Wall shoots over the highest
and steepest summits, the road pursues its
tortuous course from one platform of the rock to
another, so as to bring the traveller from mile-castle
to mile-castle by the easiest possible gradients.
Often has it been my lot to notice how naturally, towards
the close of a fatiguing day’s march, the less
zealous of our exploring party, more anxious to select
an easy track than to keep close companionship
with the Wall, have, most unconsciously, pursued
the route of the Roman way. But, notwithstanding
all the art of the engineer, the steepness of the road
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>in some places is such, that most of our modern
carmen, with all their boasted skill, would be
greatly puzzled if required to traverse it with a
waggon laden with military stores.<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c012'><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>ADDITIONAL ROAD.</div>

<p class='c000'>Although the road now described has probably
been the only carriage-way between the two great
lines of fortification, another, situated to the south
of them, has afforded direct communication between
some of the inland stations. From <span class='sc'>Cilurnum</span> to
<span class='sc'>Magna</span>, the Wall forms a curved line, in order to
gain the highest hills of the district. For the accommodation
of those whose business did not require
them to call at any intermediate point, a road went,
like the string of a bow, direct from the one station
to the other. This road, which is shewn in <a href='#p044b'>Plate II</a>.,
went near the modern village of Newburgh, where
Roman remains are occasionally found, and passed
by the north gate of <span class='sc'>Vindolana</span>, Chesterholm, near
to which a Roman mile-stone still stands. Some
portions of the ancient pavement still remain near
Morwood. It is probable that this Roman Military
Way was further continued, south of the Wall, direct
to Stanwix.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>SPEAKING TUBES IN THE WALL.</div>

<p class='c000'>If tradition is to be credited, the Romans were
not satisfied with roads as a means of rapidly communicating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>information; speaking-trumpets or pipes,
we are told, ran along the whole length of the Wall.
Of this, Drayton, long ago, sang in his Polyolbion—</p>

<p class='c014'>Townes stood upon my length, where garrisons were laid
Their limits to defend; and for my greater aid,
With turrets I was built, where sentinels were plac’d
To watch upon the Pict; so me my makers grac’d
With hollow pipes of brasse, along me still they went,
By which they in one fort still to another sent,
By speaking in the same, to tell them what to doe,
And soe from sea to sea could I be whispered through.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sir Christopher Ridley, in his letter tells us, that—</p>

<p class='c014'>In this Wall was theyr a trunck of brass, or whatever kynd
of mettal, which went from one place to another along the
Wall, and came into the Captaynes chamber, whereat they
had watchers for the same, and yf theyr had bene stryfe or
business betwyxt the enemies, and that the watchmen did
blow a horn in at the end of the truncke that came into the
chamber, and so from one to one; there was certayn money
payed yearly to the mantenance of this trunck by the inhabitants
theyrabout, and doith yet pay to some gentilmen in
Northymberland, the which money is called horn-geld money.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c012'><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE THEORY PROBABLY INCORRECT.</div>

<p class='c000'>Camden also refers to this curious tradition.
Once, but only once, have I met with this story in
my own rambles. Such myths will not long outlive
the introduction of the electric telegraph. ‘There
are no old people upon the Wall now,’ as a man of
three-score lately said to me, when I was endeavouring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>to persuade him to gather up from his still more
ancient neighbour the fire-side lore of by-gone times.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is curious to observe that a similar statement
is made respecting the <span class='sc'>Barrier</span> of the <span class='sc'>Upper Isthmus</span>.
A correspondent writes—</p>

<p class='c014'>One old man told me, that when he was young, on digging
through one of the wall stations—at Upper Croy—they came
upon stone pipes, laid horizontally in the soil, and joined at
the ends like those for water. From the elevation of the
place, it is quite obvious that they could not be water conduits.
This old person said that the idea he had heard
‘learned people’ give of these pipes, was, that they were for
speaking through. That the pipes were found, and made of
stone, not clay, is certain.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pipes of lead are occasionally met with in the ruins
of the stations, and pipes of burnt clay are of very
frequent occurrence. To this circumstance the tradition
probably owes its rise. They are not, however,
found in the Wall, and when placed in the
stations, seem to have served a different purpose.
One use to which the tile-tubes have been put has
been the transmission of warm air throughout an
apartment. The walls of one of the chambers of the
‘baths’ at <span class='sc'>Hunnum</span> were lined with them. Others
may have been used, especially in high situations, for
collecting rain-water from the roofs of the dwellings,
and conveying it to cisterns. Besides, the inutility of
the contrivance militates against the probability of its
adoption: the sentinels at their posts could easily
transmit hasty intelligence from end to end, by the
voice or by horns, without pipes imbedded in the
Wall, which, even if constructed, would probably be
useless for such a purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>This traditionary fiction is probably of more than
mediæval antiquity. Xiphiline, in his life of Severus,
tells some such marvellous tale about the towers of
Byzantium.</p>

<hr class='c020' />

<div class='sidenote'>THE MASONRY OF THE WALL.</div>

<p class='c000'>A description of the <span class='sc'>Masonry</span> of the erections
which have passed in review before us will conclude
this general examination of the Barrier.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following extract of a letter with which I have
been favoured by Robert Rawlinson, esq., Inspector
of the Board of Health, will form an excellent introduction
to the subject.</p>

<p class='c014'>I have several times thought over the subject of the Roman
Wall since I had the pleasure of seeing you. The Romans
constructed works with many different kinds of masonry;
no doubt all chosen to suit the material used, the place, and
the skill of the builders. In Rome, and Italy generally, works
of great magnificence were constructed, when the art displayed
was equal to the grandeur of the design. Such a work was
the famed Arch of Trajan, the Arch of Septimius Severus, the
Arch of Constantine, the Baths of Diocletian, and others. In
these works, construction of the highest order was used, and
the sculptor emulated the architect. The lettered altars and
sculptured figures found on the line of ‘the Wall’ must not
be compared with the best workmanship of Rome.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>NATIVE LABOURERS EMPLOYED.</div>

<p class='c014'>I am quite satisfied, in my own mind, that the general
character of the work on the Wall was adapted to suit the
time, the country, and more especially, the labourers employed
on the work. The Wall, being a work of defence, had
to be constructed in haste; the country was wild, rude, and
without roads, excepting such as the Romans caused to be
made. This ‘caused to be made’ is I think, the key to the
character of the masonry chosen.... The form of
construction is the easiest and strongest which rude, uneducated
men could accomplish; and, with good mortar, such as
the Romans knew so well how to make, is the kind of work
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>calculated to endure for centuries, as we find it has done....
The works of the Wall I consider to have been chiefly constructed
by the natives, under the armed superintendence and
teaching of the soldier. The Roman knew no right but that
of the conqueror; his object was conquest for use; use of the
land, and the labour that was upon it. The Roman soldier
was a fighting animal, and was so far civilized as to know
how to make the comparative savage do his work upon his
plan, and this was shaped to suit the labour used. Consider
the length of the Wall, and the extent of the works upon it,
and it will be seen that for the army to have constructed
it, would have been to have kept them constantly working
instead of watching and fighting.</p>

<p class='c014'>Some years ago I had a large quantity of heavy masonry to
construct on one of the railways. It was not unlike the Roman
Wall in character. I found a difficulty in dealing with
the regularly educated mason, and bought several scores of
trowels and hammers; these I placed in the hands of uneducated
labourers, set them to work under the superintendence
of educated foremen, looking after the whole myself.
This is a case similar to the one I have imagined for the
great Wall; only the work my labourers performed had
more difficulties about it than the Wall, and yet, these uneducated
men performed the work perfectly.<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c012'><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Think of the Roman bringing in at the sword’s point, hundreds

hands, indicating the work to be done, and compelling the
trembling slaves to do it!<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c012'><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The stones employed in building the Wall and
stations were very carefully selected. When good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>stones were to be had near at hand, they were taken;
but those of inferior quality were never used to avoid
the labour of bringing better from a distance. In some
parts of the line, in Cumberland especially, the stone
must have been brought from quarries seven or eight
miles off. A quartzose grit was generally selected
not only on account of its hardness, but because its
rough surface gave it a firmer adhesion to the mortar.
The stone which has been used in the works
at Wallsend is of a much coarser grit than any that
is found in the neighbourhood.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE QUARRIES USED.</div>

<p class='c000'>The quarries from which the stone has been procured
can in many instances be precisely ascertained.

quarry on the face of which the words,</p>

<p class='c000'>the rock of Flavius Carantinus—are still to be traced.
The vignette at the close of this part represents its
present condition. On opening out, in the year 1837,
some old quarries on the high, brown hill of Borcum,
near Thorngrafton, a small copper vessel was
found, containing a large number of coins, all of the
upper empire. Another Roman quarry existed on
Haltwhistle Fell. In a paper recently read before
the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle-upon-Tyne,
Mr. John Clayton says—</p>

<p class='c014'>In riding over Haltwhistle Fell, before its enclosure, in
the summer of 1844, I came upon some workmen employed
in re-opening an old quarry. They told me they had met
with a ‘written stone’; I dismounted, and climbed the face
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>of the rock, when I found inscribed in letters clear and fresh</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c019'>
    <div>LEG. VI. V.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>From its position on a wide waste, far removed from any
abode, but in the immediate vicinity of the Roman Wall, this
quarry could not possibly have been used for any other purpose
than to supply stones for the building of the Wall; and
from the freshness of the letters of the inscription, it must
have been filled up with earth soon after the soldiers ceased
to use it. The workmen promised to spare the ‘written
rock,’ but the next time I rode that way it had been shivered
to atoms.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>INSCRIPTIONS ON THE QUARRIES.</div>

<p class='c000'>In Cumberland, there are several Roman inscriptions
on the face of the ancient quarries. About a
mile west of Birdoswald, and little more than a
quarter of a mile south of the road, is Coome Crag,
which, besides other markings, presents the following
inscription—</p>

Antiquities, however, is the ‘Written Rock of the
Gelt,’ near Brampton. The lithograph on the opposite
page is a very accurate representation of this
curious relic of antiquity. As the scar is nearly
perpendicular, and the river Gelt washes its base, it
is not without some difficulty that the inquiring
visitor can give it a satisfactory examination; it will,
however, well reward his exertions, and the beauty
of the surrounding scenery will give additional zest

the terminations of
the strokes have been
thus formed. Some
doubt exists as to the precise reading of the inscription,
but the general purport of it is this:—The
vexillarii of the second legion under an optio called
Agricola, were, in the consulship of Flavius Aper
and Albinus Maximus (A.D. 207), employed to
hew stone here for the Romans.<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c012'><sup>[42]</sup></a> It is piteous,
when surveying so interesting a relic of antiquity,
and one which has outlived the accidents of upwards
of sixteen centuries, to observe that it has
been approached by men who cannot sympathize
with the mighty dead, and who care not what violence
they do to the feelings of those who can. To the
defacement, as I believe, of some portion of the inscription,
the names of <span class='fss'>F. GRAHAM</span>, <span class='fss'>W. HARDCASTLE</span>,
<span class='fss'>T. THOMPSON</span>, <span class='fss'>W. NELSON</span>, have been carved upon the
rock. Notoriety is easily earned, but it is not always
of an enviable character.</p>

<img src='images/i_p083.jpg' alt='Form of Wall-Stone' class='ig001' />
</div>

<div class='sidenote'>CHARACTER OF THE FACING-STONES.</div>

<p class='c000'>The exterior masonry of the Wall consists, on
both sides, of carefully squared free-stone blocks<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c012'><sup>[43]</sup></a>;
the interior, of rubble of any description firmly imbedded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>in mortar. The character of the facing-stones
is peculiar, yet pretty uniform. They are
eight or nine inches thick, and ten or eleven broad;
their length, which is perhaps their characteristic
feature, not unfrequently amounts to twenty inches.
The part of the stone exposed to the weather is cut
across ‘the bait,’ so as to avoid its scaling off by the
lines of stratification;
the stone tapers towards
the end which
is set into the Wall,
and has a form nearly
resembling that of a
wedge. The cut shews
its usual form. Owing
to the extent to which
the stones are set into the Wall, the necessity of
bonding tiles—so characteristic of Roman masonry
in the south of England—is altogether superseded.
There does not appear to have been a single tile
used in any part of the Wall. Stones of the shape
and size which have now been described were just
those which could be most easily wrought in the
quarry, most conveniently carried on the backs of
the poor enslaved Britons to the Wall, and most
easily fitted into their bed. The uniformity in their
appearance is such as to enable us, after a little
practice, at once to recognize them in the churches,
castles, farm-buildings, and fences of the district
through which the Wall runs.</p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>MASONRY OF THE STATIONS.</div>

<p class='c000'>In Cumberland, the stones are rather larger than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>in the eastern portion of the line, a thickness of
twelve inches not being uncommon, with a corresponding
breadth. The blocks in the north face of the
Wall, also, are not unfrequently larger than those in
the south. The stones of which the walls of the stations
are composed are smaller than those of the main
Wall. Their average thickness is from five to seven
inches, and their breadth from six to eight. The woodcut
which is here introduced, depicts the junction of
the west wall of the station of <span class='sc'>Amboglanna</span> with the
Wall, and well displays the different character of
the stones used in two erections. As already
observed, the stations appear to have been built before
the Wall, and as the necessity of the case required
that they should be run up as quickly as
possible, a smaller class of stone was allowed to pass
muster here than was used in the Wall. The workmanship
also is of inferior quality.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE TOOLING OF THE STONES.</div>

<div id='p085a'  class='figright id016'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>
<img src='images/i_p085a.jpg' alt='diamond broaching' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>The front of the stones, both of the Wall and stations,
is roughly ‘scabbled’ with the pick. In some
parts of the line, this tooling takes a definite form;
when this is the case, the marking
called the diamond broaching
is most common. Sometimes the
<span class='figleft id016'><img src='images/i_p085b.jpg' alt='waved lines' class='ig001' /></span>stone is scored with waved lines,
or with small squares, or with nearly
upright lines.
The woodcuts illustrative
of the
masonry at Chester Holm, and of
the Crypt at Hexham, to be introduced along with
<span class='figright id016'><img src='images/i_p085c.jpg' alt='upright lines' class='ig001' /></span>the account of these places, will exemplify some
of these kinds of broaching. It was not until I had
become tolerably familiar with the Wall, that my attention
was called to this peculiar kind of tooling. A
visit to <span class='sc'>Habitancum</span> and <span class='sc'>Bremenium</span>, where the
stones are nearly all broached in the diamond fashion,
induced me to inspect the Wall more narrowly in
this respect. I have since frequently detected it,
especially in Cumberland. It is rare in the Northumbrian
portion. Is this broaching peculiar to
a particular legion, or to a certain period? The
station of <span class='sc'>Habitancum</span> is understood to have
been rebuilt by Caracalla—can the other stations,
and those parts of the Wall where this kind of
marking appears, have also undergone repair at the
same time, or is it the work of some particular
legion? The same kind of broaching may be noticed
in some of the stones at Chester, the <span class='sc'>Deva</span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span><span class='sc'>Icenorum</span> of the Romans, which was for a long
time the head quarters of the 20th legion. Though
unable to resolve the doubt, I think that the prosecution
of the inquiry may lead to some worthy result.</p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>ROMAN MORTAR.</div>

<p class='c000'>The tenacity of the mortar which was used, forms
an important element in the strength of the whole
fabric. That which is in use now is generally spoiled,
from a variety of circumstances. The prevailing
practice is, first of all, to slack the lime by pouring
a quantity of water upon it when lying in a heap;
in most cases this does not sufficiently pulverize it:
it is then mixed with any earth bearing the least resemblance
to sand, and the two are worked together
very imperfectly with a shovel. The mortar thus
made often stands and hardens, so as to require to
to be once and again mixed with water, and worked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>up before it is used. It thus becomes quite impoverished;
and, after all, for the convenience of
the mason, it is employed in so dry a state that the
stone soon takes all the moisture from it, and it becomes
little better than powder. The gigantic railway
operations of recent times have driven men out
of the beaten track, and compelled them afresh to
discover the Roman method of preparing mortar.
On the authority of engineers well acquainted with
the Roman Wall, I am enabled to state, that the
mortar of that structure is precisely similar to the
grout and concrete<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c012'><sup>[45]</sup></a> of the railway mason of the
present day. Specimens of the ancient and modern
grout are before me, and there cannot be a doubt as
to the identity of their preparation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following is the mode in which the railway
engineer prepares his mortar. The lime, in the
state in which it comes from the kiln, is first ground
to powder, and is then mixed with sand and gravel,
and chippings of stone. The purposes for which
the mortar is required indicate the coarseness and
quantity of the intermingling gravel. When wanted
as concrete, to form, independently of other materials,
the foundation of some heavy structure, stony
fragments of larger size are mingled with the lime
than when the mortar is to be used to cement chiselled
stones, or even than when wanted to constitute
with rubble the interior of a wall. The mixture of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>pounded lime and gravel, when made, is not mingled
with water, until the moment of its application to the
work for which it is required, but it is then intimately
united with an abundant quantity of it. When used
as concrete, the mass will, in three hours, have solidity
sufficient to bear the weight of a man, and in
about three days it will have acquired a rock-like
firmness.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such, doubtless, is the way<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c012'><sup>[46]</sup></a> in which the mortar of
the Roman Wall was prepared, and it would have
this very important advantage over that generally
used at present, that, in a very short time, the work
would acquire a massiveness and strength, sufficient
to resist the attacks of an enemy. The mortar of
the Saxon and Norman periods is of the same character.</p>

<p class='c000'>Occasionally, but by no means frequently, small
pieces of charcoal are mixed with the mortar. These
have evidently been derived from the wood used in
burning the lime. Excepting in the buildings of
the stations, pounded tile, so characteristic of the
Roman mortar in the south of England, is by no
means a common constituent of the mortar of the
Wall. Limestone is abundant in most parts of the
district through which the Wall passes. The Romans
probably burnt it in ‘sow kilns.’ The limestone and
fuel being arranged in alternate layers, the whole was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>carefully covered with turf and ignited. This simple
method is still much resorted to when the lime is
wanted for farm purposes.</p>

<p>Sections and Elevations of the Masonry of the Wall</p>
</div>
</div>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>THE MODE OF BUILDING.</div>

<p class='c000'>Supposing the stones to be now quarried and
squared, the lime burnt and mixed with sand and
gravel, the next point to be attended to is the method
of using them. The foundation has been prepared
by the removal of the natural soil to the width of
about nine feet. In the hill district, a very scanty
portion of earth covers the rocks; in the richer
regions an excavation of from fifteen to eighteen
inches has been made before the subsoil was reached.
On the outer and inner margins of the ground thus
bared, two rows of flags of from two to four inches in
thickness, and from eighteen to twenty in breadth,
were generally laid; no mortar was placed under
them.<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c012'><sup>[47]</sup></a> On these lay the first course of facing-stones,
which were usually the largest stones used
in the structure. In higher courses the facing-stones
are uniformly of free-stone, on the ground course
a ‘whin-stone’ is occasionally introduced. The flagstones
of the foundation usually project from one to
five inches beyond the first course of facing-stones,
and these again usually stand out an inch or two beyond
the second course, after which, the wall is taken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>straight up. In some parts of the line the flagstones
do not appear in the foundation—the first
course of facing-stones being laid directly upon the
ground. In the neighbourhood of Sewingshields,
where large tracts of the Wall have been recently removed,
a careful observer informs me, that the entire
foundation has for some distance been laid upon
a bed of clay of three or four inches thick.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE RUBBLE OF THE WALL.</div>

<p class='c000'>One or two courses of facing-stones having been
placed in their beds and carefully pointed, a mass of
mortar in a very fluid state was poured into the interior
of the wall, and stones of any kind or shape
that were of a convenient size were ‘puddled’ in
amongst it. Whin-stones, as being most abundant
in the district, are generally used for the filling.
Course after course was added, and one mass of concrete
imposed upon another, until the Wall reached
the required height. When the whole was finished
it formed a solid, compact mass, without any holes or
crevices in the interior, and in a short time became
as firm as the unhewn rock.</p>

<p class='c000'>In some parts of the line the mortar has been
‘hand-laid.’ The rubble of the interior having been
first disposed in its place, the mortar has been laid
upon it with a trowel. In this case the mortar never
penetrates the interstices of the mass, and does not
make such solid masonry as the method generally
pursued. When, however, this plan is adopted, the
rubble stones are often laid upon their edges in a
slanting position; and when those of the next layer,
as occasionally occurs, are made to lean in the opposite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>direction, we have the kind of
<span id='p091' class='figright id016'><img src='images/i_p091.jpg' alt='herring-bone work' class='ig001' /></span>masonry represented in the adjoining
diagram, which is appropriately called
herring-bone work. The nearest
approach to this that I have seen upon the line of
the Wall is at Steel-rig, and Hare-hill. In Hodgson’s
Northumberland<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c012'><sup>[48]</sup></a> a section of the Wall on Walltown
crag is given, exhibiting herring-bone masonry. In
this instance the stones are disposed transversely to
the Wall, at Steel-rig and Hare-hill they are disposed
longitudinally; the latter method is the easier
of the two.<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c012'><sup>[49]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>On wavy ground the courses of the Wall follow the
undulations of the surface, but on steep inclines
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>the stones are laid parallel to the horizon. The
Wall, in this case, must have been built up from the
bottom of the defile, where also, in order the better
to resist the superincumbent mass, it not unfrequently
has a greater breadth than usual. As shewing
that different sections of the Wall have been erected
under distinct superintendents, it may occasionally
be observed that, whilst on one slope of a ‘gap’ the
stones are laid parallel to the horizon, on the other,
differing little perhaps in inclination, they are laid
even with the ground.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>DURABILITY OF THE STRUCTURE.</div>

<p class='c000'>We must now take leave of this important part
of our subject, the masonry of the Wall. Judging
from those portions of it which remain, it may safely be
asserted, that no structure can be conceived to possess
greater strength and durability. The first time I
happened to visit Bowness (in the year 1831), some
portions of the Wall, seven feet high, were in the
course of being removed; it was found necessary to
resort to the force of gunpowder in order to effect
its destruction. In the substantial nature of their
works, the Romans have left the impress of their
own mighty minds. They built not for the day.
They did not conceive that their existence was bound
up in the fate of a single generation, but that it was
spread over the destinies of succeeding ages. Their
works contrast strongly with the efforts of some
modern builders. The editor of the pictorial volume,
styled ‘Old England,’ seems, in the following
passage, to speak from personal observation.</p>

<p class='c014'>Passing by the fragments of which we have spoken, we are
under the north wall [of Richborough]—a wondrous work
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>calculated to impress us with a conviction that the people
who built it were not the petty labourers of an hour, who
were contented with temporary defences and frail resting
places. The outer works upon the southern cliff of Dover,
which were run up during the war with Napoleon, at prodigious
expense, are crumbling and perishing, through the
weakness of job and contract, which could not endure for
half a century. And here stand the walls of Richborough,
as they have stood for eighteen hundred years, from twenty
to thirty feet high, eleven or twelve feet thick at the base,
with their outer masonry in many parts as perfect as at the
hour when their courses of tiles and stones were first laid in
beautiful regularity.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>ITS EVENTUAL DECAY.</div>

<p class='c000'>If the meddling hand of man had been withheld
from the Barrier of the Lower Isthmus, the Wall
might have stood, even to the present hour, in almost
its original integrity. It is necessary to say
‘almost,’ for nothing can be more correct than the
observation of Hodgson—</p>

<p class='c014'>Though man has had the chief labour in effecting its destruction,
its whole line and all its stations, castles, and
towers, ever since it was deserted by the Romans, have
been incessantly suffering prostration by the hand of nature.
The feeble roots of grasses, ferns, and shrubs, have been assisted
by the more destructive wedges and levers of forest
trees in levelling it with the ground; and, in many places in
the west of this county, for considerable distances together,
the ruins that time has thrown from its brow, lie in a deep
green mound at its feet; and thorns, briars, hazel, and mountain
ash (entwined with relentless ivy), are still, in the parts
that remain above ground, at the labour of demolition in
which, for the last fourteen centuries, they have been unceasingly
engaged.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this day, when the Arabic numerals assert an influence
quite as potent as that which the lictors’ rods
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>obtained in ancient Rome, the inquiries may not be
destitute of interest—What amount of labour was
involved in the construction of the Barrier, in what
time could it be accomplished, and what, at the present
value of labour and materials, would be the cost
of its construction?</p>

<div class='sidenote'>MONEY VALUE OF THE BARRIER.</div>

<p class='c014'>The Wall is sixty-eight miles long; granting that it was
only sixteen feet high, but had a continuous thickness of
eight feet, we have 1,702,115 cubic yards of masonry, to say
nothing of stations, mile-castles, and turrets.</p>

<p class='c014'>Twelve shillings per cubic yard is as near as may be the
present value of masonry, such as that of which the Roman
Wall consists—the cost of this part of the structure would
therefore be 1,021,269<em>l.</em></p>

<p class='c014'>Taking into account that the labour was forced, each cubic
yard of the Wall would, at the least, require, in quarrying
the stone, its carriage to the Wall, its setting, and other
operations, one entire day’s exertions of one man. In this
way we have 1,702,115 days’ labour in the stone Wall.</p>

<p class='c014'>Taking the north fosse at the dimensions already given, its
excavation would involve the removal of 5,585,072 cubic
yards. A modern excavator, stimulated by pay proportioned
to his work, enjoying food, and raiment, and shelter, such as
the ancient Briton was a stranger to, and possessing the advantage
of good tools, and good organization, can remove the
enormous quantity of twenty cubic yards of earth per day.
The labourer, driven to his ungrateful task by a Roman task-master,
and compelled to support himself as best he might,
and to labour with tools of the rudest construction, would
not accomplish the half of this task; the removal of eight
yards <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>per diem</em></span> would probably be an average day’s work. The
excavation of the north fosse would thus, under these circumstances,
involve 698,134 days’ labour. At the present time,
when twenty cubic yards may be removed per man in a day,
and when a day’s wages may be set down at half-a-crown, the
whole cost of the excavation of the fosse would be 34,906<em>l.</em></p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>In this estimate no account has been taken of the increased
labour occasioned by cutting through the rocks that are sometimes
met with. The entire absence of the ditch, however, in
the hilly district, compensates for this omission.</p>

<p class='c014'>The fosse of the Vallum is rather less than that of the
Wall. Making a deduction of one-third on this account, and
supposing that the distance which the Vallum falls short of
the Wall at each extremity, makes amends for the increased
labour of cutting through the rocky ground, we have 3,723,382
cubic yards to be removed, involving 465,422 days of forced
labour. The whole could now be done for the sum of
23,271<em>l.</em> No account is taken of the labour expended in
raising the earthen ramparts, or the cost of their construction,
for the reason, that the removal of the earth from the
fosse implied its being deposited somewhere; no place would
be more convenient for this purpose than the mounds of the
rampart.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>TIME REQUIRED FOR ITS CONSTRUCTION.</div>

<p class='c014'>Adding together these results, we find that the cost of the
Wall and its north fosse would be 1,056,175<em>l.</em>, and that the
cost of the Vallum, added to this would form a total of
1,079,446<em>l.</em> The number of days’ labour involved in the
Wall would be 2,400,249, and, adding to this, that of the
Vallum, we have for the whole 2,865,671 days’ labour.</p>

<p class='c014'>The largest number of men that we can conceive to be
brought to bear at once upon the Wall, including such of the
Roman troops as could be spared from military operations,
is ten thousand. This body, at the rate already supposed,
would, by continuous labour, execute the Wall and its
ditch in 240 days, and, taking the Vallum also into account,
in 286 days. In the exposed district over which the Wall
runs, it is not probable that the weather would allow of the
work being pursued during more than two hundred days in
the year. If, in addition to this, we make deductions for
the chances of war, two years may be stated as the shortest
time in which the whole of the works could be executed.</p>

<p class='c000'>A recent writer, who, in a work denominated ‘A
History of the Picts or Romano-British Wall,’ adopts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>the notion of Gildas, that the stone wall was built,
not by Hadrian or Severus, but by the trembling
Britons on their abandonment by the Romans, supports
his opinion by denominating the work an un-Roman-like
defence, and argues that men who were
unaccustomed to fear, would not seek the assistance
of a wall and a ditch. However regardless of life
the Romans may, in the abstract, have been, they
knew how to economize their resources. In the battle
of the Grampians, Agricola withheld his legionary
soldiers, and made use only of his auxiliary
troops. He could better afford to expend the one
than the other. As well might a warrior despise
the protection of a helmet or a shield, as refuse the
defence of a stone wall.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>WALLS NOT UNWORTHY OF ROME.</div>

<p class='c000'>The best refutation, however, of this theory, is the
fact, that in other places the Romans, about the same
period, raised similar barriers. At two of these we
shall glance, before beginning a detailed inspection
of the Barrier of the Lower Isthmus. The comparison
will probably afford valuable instruction.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE GERMAN BARRIER.</div>

<p class='c000'>The <span class='sc'>Devil’s Wall</span>, in Germany, bears many marks
of resemblance to the English Wall. It seems<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c012'><sup>[50]</sup></a> to
consist of the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><em>Pfahl</em></span>, a mound of stakes, or vallum,
ascribed to Hadrian, and a stone wall which is said to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>have been executed by some of his successors. The
works extended westwards from Regensburg [Ratisbon]
on the Danube, towards the sources of that river,
a distance of nearly two hundred miles. They formed
the boundary of the Roman empire in those parts
where the Danube was not broad and deep enough
to be of itself a sufficient protection. A deep trench
ran along the Wall on its northern side, and along
its southern face roads and camps were formed. At
regular intervals of one mile, towers of observation
were placed of the same size, though, being circular,
not of the same form as the mile-castles on the
English Wall. It is not possible, from the present
remains, to determine with certainty the height or
breadth of the Wall. ‘I found it in many places,’
says Professor Buchner, ‘from four to six, in others
from ten to twelve, feet broad. We may therefore
perhaps conclude, that its medium breadth was from
six to seven feet, and that its height, as corresponding
to this breadth, may have been from eighteen
to twenty-four feet.’ The works have the same
tendency to advance in a straight line as those of
our own Barrier. ‘No mountain is so high, no abyss
so steep, no wood so thick, no morass so profound,
through which it does not penetrate.’ ‘The whole
line of the fortification has been laid down and executed
according to a well-digested plan.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE ANTONINE WALL.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Graham’s Dike</span>, so denominated probably from
the Celtic words <i>grym</i>, strength, and <i>diog</i>, a ditch,
is a barrier which fortified the Upper Isthmus of
Britain. It extended from Borrowstoness, on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>Firth of Forth, to West Kilpatrick, on the river
Clyde, a distance of about twenty-seven English
miles. It was constructed by Lollius Urbicus in the
reign of Antoninus Pius, the adopted son of Hadrian.
The following succinct account of this important
design is taken from the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Caledonia Romana,’</span> a work
of great ability, by the late lamented Mr. Robert
Stuart, of Glasgow:—</p>

<p class='c014'>This great military work consisted, in the first place, of an
immense fosse or ditch—averaging about forty feet in width,
by some twenty in depth—which extended over hill and plain,
in one unbroken line, from sea to sea. Behind this ditch, on
its southern side, and within a few feet of its edge, was raised
a rampart of intermingled stone and earth, strengthened by
sods of turf, which measured, it is supposed, about twenty
feet in height, and twenty-four in thickness at the base. This
rampart, or <em>agger</em>, was surmounted by a parapet, behind
which ran a level platform, for the accommodation of its defenders.
To the southward of the whole was situated the
Military Way—a regular causewayed road, about twenty-feet
wide—which kept by the course of the Wall at irregular
distances, approaching, in some instances, to within a few
yards, and in others receding to a considerable extent. Along
the entire line there were established, it is believed, nineteen
principal stations or forts. The mean distance between each
may be stated at rather more than two English miles. Along
these intervals were placed many smaller <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>castella</em></span>, or watch-towers.
While the continuous rampart seems to have been
little more than a well-formed earthen mound, it is probable
that many, if not all, of the stations, were either rivetted
with stone or entirely built of that material. In some places,
it would even appear that the Vallum itself had been raised
upon a stone foundation—probably in situations where the
ground was low and marshy, and where it was found necessary
to form drains beneath the works, to prevent the
accumulation of water on their anterior side.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>MUTUAL SUPPORT OF THE BARRIERS.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>The Barrier of the Upper Isthmus never consisted
of more than a single line of fortification. This
circumstance may seem to militate against the view
that we have taken of the double line of the Southern
Barrier. If in the one case the conquered tribes to
the south were disregarded, why should they not be so
in the other also? We shall not, however, greatly err
if we regard the Antonine Wall as but an advanced
work of Hadrian’s entrenchment. On this view of
the matter, the difficulty is at once removed, for the
Lower Barrier would be a sufficient security against
danger in the rear. Certain it is, that the southern line
was not abandoned when the other was constructed.
Several altars have been found on the Lower Barrier
inscribed with the name Antoninus Pius.<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c012'><sup>[51]</sup></a> A slab
bearing the names of the consuls Sex. Sulpicius
Tertullus, and C. Tineius Sacerdos, elicits the following
remarks from judge Cay<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c012'><sup>[52]</sup></a>:—</p>

<p class='c014'>These were consuls in A.D. 158; consequently, we have
undeniable authority to assert, that Antoninus Pius repaired
Hadrian’s Vallum (or, at least, the stations <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>per lineam
Valli</em></span>), as well as built one between the Scottish Firths. This
stone is certainly most valuable, as it clearly proves, that
though Antoninus extended the boundary so far north, he
could not, or durst not, trust the Mæatæ, but thought himself
obliged to keep up the southern pretenturæ, lest they should,
on any disturbance, join the Caledonians.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such prudence is characteristic of good generalship.
Napoleon never made an important move
without first resolving what to do in case of failure.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>Assuredly Hadrian did not act in a manner unbecoming
a Roman, when, at the same time that he
shewed a stony front to the Caledonians, he placed
an earthen rampart between himself and the doubtful
fidelity of his southern subjects.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE BARRIERS IN RELATION TO THE RIVERS.</div>

<p class='c000'>The position of the Barriers of the Lower and of
the Upper Isthmus, and of the Devil’s Wall, in relation
to the rivers in their vicinity, requires some
remark. The Tyne in the eastern, and the Irthing
and the Eden in the western part of the island, are
uniformly to the south of the English Wall. A similar
remark applies to the Devil’s Wall, in Germany,
which is drawn along the northern shore of the Danube,
the side exposed to the enemy. The Clyde, and
its feeders, are to the south of the Antonine Wall.
Why did the Romans not avail themselves of the
natural trenches of these river-basins? The valley
of the Tyne is peculiarly broad and deep. A chain
of camps on its southern bank, where the mediæval
castles afterwards stood, would alone, we might suppose,
have bid defiance to the passage of any foe.</p>

<p class='c000'>A similarity of practice in these cases favours the
belief that important objects were to be accomplished
by it. What are they?—</p>

<p class='c000'>By erecting a chain of posts on the high grounds
to the north of the rivers, a better observation of the
movements of the enemy was obtained than would
otherwise have been practicable. In the days of
Roman occupation, large tracts of country, the banks
of rivers especially, would be covered with forests.
The conquerors, unless they had secured the enemy’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>side of the river-basins, would have been perpetually
subject to unexpected attacks. They could not be
so easily taken by surprise on the high grounds of
the northern slopes.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>IMPORTANCE OF RIVER BASINS.</div>

<p class='c000'>Probably the value of the land on the margin of the
rivers, was an additional motive for the course pursued.
The alluvial soil by a river’s side is usually the
most fertile portion of a country. The banks of the
Tyne and the Eden are peculiarly productive.
Without a wall the enemy would have had undisputed
possession of the slopes which enjoyed the
finest aspect—that to the south—while those on the
other side would have been subject to frequent depredation.
This consideration is of the more importance,
as the lands of the district were given to the soldiers
who garrisoned the frontier, as a means of securing
their fidelity.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>PRUDENCE OF THE ROMANS.</div>

<p class='c000'>So far from the importance of the natural boundary,
the river, being overlooked by the Romans,
I am disposed to regard the works on its northern
bank as a proof of the value which they set
upon it. The natural and the artificial barriers
were probably regarded by them as but separate
members of one complete fortification. In case of a
rush of invasion from the North, the Wall would arrest
the attack and the river entirely repel it. The stone
and earth works would impede the progress of a foe,
however formidable, and give time for the formation
of an army on the southern bank of the stream. It
was, moreover, ‘political in the Romans,’ as Stukely
remarks,<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c012'><sup>[53]</sup></a> 'to leave on the north side of the Wall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>that huge tract of waterless and dismal moor, a great
barren solitude, where in some places you may
walk sixty miles endwise, without meeting with a
house or tree; to ride is impracticable. Thus, as
much as in them lay, without the horror of barbarity,
did they remove the barbarians from their territories;
whilst within the Wall, either naturally or by their
industry, all things smiled like the garden of Eden.'</p>

<p class='c000'>The vast hosts which the Caledonians were able
to muster rendered all these precautions necessary;
and it was, moreover, becoming in the Romans—a
generation of warriors the mightiest the world has
ever seen—to plant the foot firmly on any land they
thought fit to occupy. Assuredly they did so in the
Lower Isthmus of Britain.</p>

Little did the Romans
dream, when they fixed
the eastern termination
of their Wall
at <span class='sc'>Segedunum</span>, of the
world-wide celebrity
which its subsequent
cognomen—Wallsend—would
attain. Even
Horsley, writing in
1731, and in what he lovingly terms 'my own
county,'<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c012'><sup>[54]</sup></a> did not foresee the extensive mining operations
which shortly after his day were to take place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>in its immediate vicinity. In order to mark the site
of the station, he fixes upon Cousin’s House, which
is at some distance from the spot, whereas, the
principal shaft of the celebrated mine is close
beside its western rampart.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>SEGEDUNUM, Wallsend, is admirably selected
as the site of a Roman station, and as the eastern
terminus of the Wall. Without being so much<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>SEGEDUNUM.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
elevated as to give it a painful exposure to the
blasts of the north and of the east, it commands a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>view, in every direction, of the adjacent country.
The ground, in front of it, slopes rapidly down to
the river’s brink, and has a full exposure to the
mid-day sun. The beauty of its situation is considerable
now; what must it have been when aged
oaks crowned the contiguous heights, and the Tyne
rolled by in the brilliancy and exuberance of its
youth!</p>

<div class='sidenote'>WALLSEND.</div>

<p class='c000'>Eastward of Wallsend, the river acquires a sufficient
magnitude to make it a barrier quite formidable
enough to prevent the ready passage of a foe, and
to render the erection of a wall unnecessary. Frequently,
however, would it be needful for the watchful
eye of the Roman prefect at <span class='sc'>Segedunum</span> to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>traverse the expanse which lay between him and
the sea. This he could easily do. The station
stands upon a bend of the river, formed by two of
the longest ‘reaches’ which it makes in the whole of
its course. The Long-reach extends downwards
as far as the high end of South Shields, and the
Bill-reach stretches nearly two miles up the water.
In both directions, therefore, any operations conducted
on the river would be easily discerned from
the station.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>SEGEDUNUM.</div>

<p class='c000'>Although it was not thought requisite to extend
the Wall further along the northern bank of the
Tyne than Wallsend, special precautions were taken
to secure the mouth of the river from hostile occupation.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>A camp at Tynemouth, and another at
North Shields, were garrisoned by troops from the
head quarters at <span class='sc'>Segedunum</span>; these frowned over
the northern shore of the estuary. A subsidiary
station at Tyne Lawe, near South Shields, and another
at Jarrow, guarded its southern bank, whilst one at
Wardley, opposite Wallsend, would effectually support,
on that side of the river, the operations of the
garrison in the principal encampment. All of these
will be examined afterwards.</p>

<div id='p109'  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_p109.jpg' alt='Altar to Jupiter-Coh. IV. Lingonum' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>The evidence by which Wallsend is identified
with the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Segedunum</em></span> of the Notitia is not so direct
as could be desired. First in the list of officers
‘along the line of the Wall,’ the Notitia places the
Tribune of the fourth cohort of the Lergi at <span class='sc'>Segedunum</span>.
Now, no inscription has been found in Britain
mentioning the Lergi, but inscriptions have been
found which mention the second and fourth cohorts
of the Lingones; on the other hand, the Lingones
never occur in the Notitia, but the cohorts of the
Lergi which are there recorded, are the second and the
fourth. This being the case, and the difference in the
form of the Latin words <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Lergorum</em></span> and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Lingonum</em></span>
being very slight, the probability is, as Mr. Thomas
Hodgson, in an able paper in the Archæologia Æliana,
conjectures, that some early transcriber of the
Notitia has written the one in mistake for the
other. Within the precincts of Tynemouth Castle,
in the year 1783, an altar was found, which formed
part of the foundation of an ancient church. It is
now in the possession of the Society of Antiquaries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>of London. The adjoining wood-cut accurately delineates
it. The inscription may be read as follows:</p>

  </div>
</div>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>On the supposition, which is a natural one, that
Tynemouth was a station subsidiary to Wallsend,
this altar gives satisfactory proof that the first of
the stations at the eastern extremity of the Wall is
the <span class='sc'>Segedunum</span> of the Notitia. On some occasion,
when the prefect who commanded the estuary of the
Tyne, was on a visit to this out-post, he erected to
Jupiter, whom he ignorantly worshipped, the altar
which still remains.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>ORIGIN OF THE NOTITIA NAMES.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>The etymology of the names of the stations is an
interesting, but intricate subject. The new occupants
of a country usually adopt the appellations bestowed by
their predecessors upon its more prominent features.
Thus, though in England the ancient Briton, Roman,
Saxon, Norman, and modern English, have successively
prevailed, many of our most familiar rivers, as
the Thames, the Isis, and the Avon, have borne, as
Whitaker shows, through each successive change,
their present names. The appellations of cities are
much more variable, but some even of these are indelible.
Strange as a painted Briton of the first century
would feel himself in the streets of modern London,
its <em>name</em> would fall on his ear as an accustomed sound.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Romans were a minority in Britain; and, in
their intercourse with the natives, would be compelled
to adopt the nomenclature of the people. We may,
therefore, expect to find that the names of the stations
are essentially British, though somewhat altered
by the imperfect pronunciation of the strangers, and
by a ceaseless effort to recast the words in the mould of
their own tongue. The change most frequently introduced
consists in the addition of Latin terminations.
The names given by the aborigines of a
country are usually descriptive of the object to which
they are attached: they are epithets changed into proper
names. Accordingly, we find that the names of the
stations, so far as they have been deciphered by the
assistance of those modern representatives of the
ancient British tongue—the Gaelic and native Irish—are
descriptive of the locality.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>ETYMOLOGY OF SEGEDUNUM.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span><span class='sc'>Segedunum</span> is an unfortunate example to begin
with. There was a Segedunum in Aquitania, the modern
Rodez—a Segodunum in Northern Germany, the
modern Siegen. The camp at Wallsend may have
received its name from some resemblence to one of
these. Still the question remains, What was the
common origin of the term? Wallis thinks it is
derived from the Latin <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>seges</em></span>, corn, and the Celtic
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>dunum</em></span>, a hill; but, excepting in extreme cases, an
etymology dependent upon two languages can scarcely
be admitted. A more consistent derivation is found
in the Celtic <em>sech</em>, (the root of the French <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>sec</em></span>) dry,
and <em>dun</em>, a hill. The final syllable is a Latin affix.
The elevation of the spot, and its rapid slope to the
river, would render it comparatively free from
moisture.<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c012'><sup>[55]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>VILLAGE OF WALLSEND.</div>

<p class='c000'>The number of places along the course of the Wall
which have derived their names from this great work,
is very striking, and proves the importance that has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>been attached to it. Without examining a map, and
simply drawing upon the resources of my own memory
and note-book, the following examples occur: In
Northumberland, we have Wallsend, Walker, Wall-knoll
in Newcastle, Benwell, Wallbottle, Heddon-on-the-Wall,
Welton, Wall-houses, Wall, Walwick,
Shields-on-the-Wall, Wall-mill, Walltown, Thirlwall,
and Wall-end; in Cumberland, we have Walton,
Wallbours, Old-Wall, High Wallhead, Middle Wallhead,
Low Wallhead, Wallby, and Wallfoot.</p>

<p class='c000'>The present village of Wallsend is about half a
mile distant from the station, a little to the north of
the turnpike road. It is, however, of modern erection.
Brand says that ‘an old woman, still living, remembers
when the site of the present Wallsend was an empty
field.’ The traditional account of its erection is,
that a plague having desolated the original town,
which stood upon the site of the camp, and was
built out of its ruins, the terrified inhabitants forsook
the spot, and sought shelter in the new locality.</p>

<p class='c000'>A person unaccustomed to examine the remains
of Roman forts, will probably be disappointed to find
the ramparts of Wallsend so feebly marked; but one
who brings to the task a practised eye, will give a
good account of the land, and express his surprise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>that so much of the camp is left. The station, it
must be remembered, is situated on the edge of a
river the scene of an immense commerce, in the
vicinity of a large town, and in the centre of a great
mining district.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>SEGEDUNUM.</div>

<p class='c000'>The station of <span class='sc'>Segedunum</span> has occupied an area
of three acres and a half. The Wall, coming from
the west, has struck the north cheek of its western
gateway, and there terminated. The walls of the
station would be a sufficient protection to the garrison
against attack from the north or other quarters, but
to prevent the enemy getting within the barrier, by
passing between the station and the river, the eastern
wall of the station has been brought down to the
river, and continued into it to low-water mark.<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c012'><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>WALLSEND.</div>

<p class='c000'>In tracing the outline of the station it will be well
to begin at Carville-hall, the 'Cousin’s-house,'<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c012'><sup>[57]</sup></a> of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>Horsley. Between it and the Gosforth ‘waggon-way,’
the north fosse of the Wall is very distinct, a
gravelled path, for some distance, occupies the site
of the Wall.<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c012'><sup>[58]</sup></a> Behind the Methodist-chapel the
ditch may still be traced, but after that it disappears.
The row of houses between the chapel and the station
is manifestly very close upon the line of the
Wall. The old engine-house, which Brand tells us
was six yards north of the Wall, still remains.
The whole of the ramparts of the northern section of
the station are gone; the walls of the southern portion
of it may, however, be traced rising in the form
of a grassy mound above the general level of the
soil. The continuation of the eastern wall of the
station down the bank to the river’s edge, may also
be recognised, not only by the gentle mound which
it forms, but by the fragments of Roman mortar,
Roman tile, and coarse-grained sandstone, not proper
to the district, which may be picked up on it. This
river-wall joins the Tyne at the spot where a jetty
has recently been formed. Numerous swellings in
the ground to the south, and to the east of the station,
indicate the ruins of suburban buildings. These
seem to have been invariable concomitants of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>stationary camps. Officers wishing to have more
space than the fort allowed, the families of the
soldiers, the camp followers, and others, who sought
the protection of a fortified post, would occupy such
dwellings. The sunny exposure of the streets on the
south of the camp, would render them peculiarly
acceptable to the Lingones who came from that part
of Gaul where the Meuse and Marne have their
source.<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c012'><sup>[59]</sup></a> The fosse which protected the eastern
rampart, is still distinctly visible, and generally contains
a little water. The accompanying lithographic
view is given chiefly with the intention of showing
the extensive command which the station had of the
river below it; the south-east angle of the rampart
may be traced upon it, as well as the fosse beyond.
The altar, represented in the foreground, was found
in the vicinity of the station a few years ago, and is
still preserved upon the spot, it is without an inscription,
but has a hole drilled through its centre,
which it had when found. An extensive
natural valley protected the western side of the
camp, which some years ago was partially filled
up, in order to form the waggon-way. The house
occupied by the late Mr. John Buddle, the eminent
colliery viewer, is just within the western wall of the
station, and that, formerly occupied by Mr. John
Reay, is just within the eastern rampart. The
waggon-way leading from the Wallsend pit seems to
enter the station by its western portal, and to leave it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>by its eastern, and thus exactly traverses the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>via
principalis</em></span> of the camp. The only trace of the
northern division of the station that remains, consists
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>SEGEDUNUM.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>of the road which has apparently led from <span class='sc'>Segedunum</span>
to the out-posts at Blake-chesters and Tyne-mouth.
This causeway extends from the station to
the north of the Shields railway; it is formed of a mass
of rubble, about two feet deep, and is eleven yards
wide. It cannot be ploughed, and nothing that
requires any depth of earth will grow upon it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Numerous proofs of Roman occupation have been
discovered at various times in the station and its
vicinity. Brand says, ‘I found a fibula, some Roman
tegulæ, and coins, a ring, &amp;c. Immense quantities
of bones and teeth of animals are continually turning
up. Stones with inscriptions were found, but the
incurious masons built them up again in the new
works of the colliery.’ Dr. Lingard was told, that in
digging a cellar under the dining room of Mr. Buddle’s
house, a deep well was found. I have been
informed by Mr. John Reay, that another was discovered
outside the station, at the spot shown on
the plan of the station, <a href='#p112b'>Plate IV</a>. A structure, which
was conceived to be a bath, was struck upon about
the same time, near the river’s brink; it was immediately
removed, but its site is marked on the
plan. Many coins have been found, but most of
them in a very corroded state. A beautiful piece of
Samian ware was got in sinking the shaft of the
colliery, which is now in possession of the Society
of Antiquaries of Newcastle-upon-Tyne; it is figured
in a subsequent Plate.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>WALLSEND TO NEWCASTLE.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>Leaving Wallsend, and proceeding westward, the
Wall is chiefly to be traced by the presence of its
north fosse. This is very distinctly marked nearly
all the way to Byker. In front of Stote’s-houses, the
Beehouses of Horsley, it forms a pond, which is used
for farm purposes. Some traces of the foundation
of the Wall may be seen, but they are faint. Thirty
years ago the Wall was standing, for a considerable
distance, three and four feet high, covered with
brushwood of hazel, oak, and alder. The tendency
of the half-ruined Wall to give lodgement to the
roots of these plants, is very remarkable; wherever
the Wall is undisturbed they are found, and in regions
where the hazel does not occur elsewhere, as
in the neighbourhood of Bowness, it is to be met
with abundantly upon the Wall.</p>

<p class='c000'>A mound, a little more elevated than the neighbouring
ground, near to Stote’s-houses, points out the
site of the first mile-castle west of Wallsend. The
tenant of the farm told me that he had got a great
quantity of stones from it. In Horsley’s time, there
were ‘two distinct tumuli remaining near the Bee-houses’;
what I take to be the rudiments of them
may yet be traced; one of them is just behind the
stack-yard of the farm, the other, the least marked
of the two, a little to the west of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The road that is seen stretching in a straight line
up the hill to Byker indicates the direction of the
Wall, and though the first, it is by no means the most
remarkable instance that we shall meet with, of the
unflinching and straightforward tendencies of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>remarkable structure. The Wall stood on the south
side of the present road. The facing-stones having
already been removed, and it being desirable to
have the rocky remnant entirely cleared away, the
ground was let to parties without rent for a short
term of years, on condition of their clearing it, and
bringing it into cultivation. It is on this account
that the site of the Wall and fosse, even yet, is portioned
out in long narrow slips, which are, for the
most part, used as potato gardens.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the top of Byker-hill, an interesting view
is obtained of the Tyne and the numerous hives of
busy men which bestud its banks. This would be
an important post for the Roman soldier, who could
easily see from it the stations on either hand—<span class='sc'>Segedunum</span>
and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='sc'>Pons Ælii</span></span>—and all that was going
on between them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Between Byker and Newcastle, all traces of the
Wall are now nearly destroyed. In 1725, it was,
however, standing in a condition of imposing grandeur,
as appears from Stukeley’s ‘Prospect’ of it in
the Iter Boreale. He was induced to make this
drawing because ‘the country being entirely undermined’
by colliery excavations, it might ‘some time
or other sink, and so disorder the track of this stately
work.’ He dreaded an imaginary evil, and overlooked
a real one.</p>

<p class='c000'>The north fosse was, till recently, very distinct
within the wall of Heaton-park; it is now filled
up; many of the stones in the park-wall, are to
all appearance, Roman. Before descending the hill,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>a portion of it, boldly developed, may yet be seen at
the end of a small row of houses called Howard-street.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>COURSE THROUGH NEWCASTLE.</div>

<p class='c000'>At the head of the bank overlooking the Ouse-burn
stood a mile-castle, as was usual in such situations,
to guard the pass. Two stones which, I am
persuaded, formed part of the entrance gateway of
this mile-tower, now stand upon the stairs leading to
the grand entrance of the keep of the Castle of
Newcastle-upon-Tyne. They measure two feet by
one, and are of the form usually employed in the
portals of mile castles. One of them bears a rude,
and almost unintelligible, inscription. These stones
were found built up in a structure on the west bank
of the Ouseburn, were thence taken to Busy Cottage,
afterwards removed to Heaton, and finally presented
to the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle-upon-Tyne.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Wall crossed the Ouse-burn very near the ancient
bridge which is about a hundred and fifty yards south
of the railway viaduct. In preparing the foundations
of Mr. Beckinton’s steam-mill about the year 1800,
the workmen came upon the Wall, and, with great
good taste, built into the opposite quay three of the
largest stones they met with, in order to mark its
site; they may yet be seen at low water, and are
evidently mile-castle stones.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>COURSE THROUGH NEWCASTLE.</div>

<p class='c000'>It is not possible to trace the Wall with minute
accuracy through Newcastle, a town which has been
the seat of a large and active population ever since
the days of Roman occupation. In endeavouring to
follow its route, I shall mainly depend upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>investigations of Mr. George Bouchier Richardson,
who has for several years past made the antiquities
of ‘the Metropolis of the North’ his especial study,
and whose paper upon this subject, recently read
before the Society of Antiquaries of this town, will
doubtless speedily appear in the Archæologia Æliana.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>NEWCASTLE-UPON-TYNE.</div>

<p class='c000'>Rising from the western bank of the Ouse-burn,
it traversed the north side of Stepney-bank, passed
through the gardens at the Red Barns, along the
site of the present Melbourne-street, and, proceeding
behind the Keelmen’s Hospital, came to the
Sallyport. This, which was one of the gates of the
town, is sometimes described as a Roman building,
but is of mediæval origin. Thence, the Wall went
over the crest of the hill still called the Wall-knoll,
where the foundations of it were turned up about
the middle of the last century. It crossed Pandon-dean
on the north side of the locality called the
Stock-bridge, and, in its western course, ascended
the steep hill, on the summit of which
stands All Saints’ church. Brand tells us that
the crypt of the old church had plainly been built
of stones plundered from the adjacent Wall. A well
of Roman masonry is said to have been discovered
near the church when the foundations of the new building
were prepared. Crossing Pilgrim-street a little
above Silver-street, the course of the Wall is indicated
by the present narrow street called the Low
bridge. Until a comparatively recent period, the
site of Dean-street formed the unenclosed bed of the
Lort-burn, and was spanned by an arch called the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>Low-bridge. At the point where this mediæval viaduct
stood, its Roman predecessor carried the Wall,
with its attendant military way, across the gully.
The church of St. Nicholas, according to Leland,
whose statement is confirmed by subsequent writers,
‘stondithe on the very Picts Waulle.’ The Wall,
leaving the church, crosses Collingwood-street in an
oblique direction, and passing by St. John’s church,
the Vicarage-house, and the Assembly-rooms, makes
for the Town-wall somewhat to the north of the site
of the West-gate. There can be little doubt that in
its exit from the town, the Wall occupied the elevation
on which Cumberland-row now stands.</p>

<div class='sidenote c015'>PONS ÆLII.</div>

<p class='c000'>PONS ÆLII.—Having tracked the Wall in its
passage through the modern town, the site of the
ancient station of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='sc'>Pons Ælii</span></span> next demands attention.</p>

<p class='c000'>Horsley is the only writer who has attempted to
define its limits, and he had but slender evidence to
guide him. He takes, as his data, the three following
facts:—1. The course of the Wall westward, which
he conceives, and no doubt correctly, would form
the northern boundary of the station; 2. The direction
of the Vallum, some portions of which remained,
in his day, just outside the West-gate; 3. 'A traditionary
account of the Wall having passed through
St. George’s porch, near the north-west corner of
St. Nicholas’-church.' As this porch stands a little
to the south of the line of the great Wall, as laid down
by him, he conceives that this traditionary wall must
have been the east wall of the station, and draws it upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>his plan accordingly.<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c012'><sup>[60]</sup></a> The western wall now only
remained to be determined, and this point was easily
settled, by supposing the station to have been square.
According to the line assigned by him to the Vallum,
six chains is the distance which would intervene
between it and the Wall; he therefore places
the western rampart of the station at the corresponding
distance of six chains from the eastern, and
encloses altogether an area of little more than three
acres.</p>

<p class='c000'>It may well be doubted whether the important
station of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='sc'>Pons Ælii</span></span> would be subjected to the ordinary
rules of castrametation. I am strongly disposed
to think, that it would partake of the features
of a commercial as well as of a military capital, and
that its walls would not only embrace a wider range
than ordinary camps, but would be allowed to adapt
themselves more freely to the nature of the ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>The wants of the immense body of troops required
to garrison the Wall, and man its out-posts, would
create a considerable amount of commerce. The
inhabitants of Italy, Gaul, and Spain, would be
unwilling all at once to forego the comforts and
luxuries of their sunny climes, and to be entirely
cut off from intercourse with the land of their nativity.
The fragments of amphoræ, which are so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>abundantly met with on the line of the Wall, shew
that the soldiers sometimes gladdened their hearts
with the wine of their native hills; and the innumerable
sherds of Samian ware, which usually bestrew
the camps of Roman occupation, prove that a continual
intercourse was kept up with the continent.
To the sea, as a means of communication between
many of the stations of Roman Britain, frequent recourse
would be had.</p>

<p class='c000'>The exports from this island to the continent were
considerable. Camden tells us, that every year not
less than eight hundred vessels laden with corn alone
were sent out of it. Certain it is, that the imperial
government would expect an adequate return for
the expenditure occasioned by the troops in this
country, and that the commodities of the continent
would not be transmitted to the occupants of the
Wall from motives of mere benevolence. Lead,
which is now so abundant in the three northern
counties, would probably form one article of export,
and corn another. Those who have noticed the fertility
of some portions of the region watered by the
Tyne, will be able to conceive how luxuriant were
the harvests which its alluvial soil produced when
first turned up by the plough. It is certain that coal
has been wrought to some extent in Roman times,
and some of it may have been exported.</p>

<p class='c000'>No place in the north of England was so well fitted
as Newcastle to be the emporium of the commerce of
the North. Situated upon a noble river, at about ten
miles from its mouth, it combined the naval advantages
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>of the coast, with the security of an inland
situation. The wealth arising from the commerce
of the port would increase its importance, and the
facility with which foreign news and foreign luxuries
could be obtained, would render it the frequent resort
of those prefects and tribunes whose usual posts
were in bleaker and more inhospitable regions.
The fact that the river was at this part spanned by a
bridge of many arches, is a striking indication of
the importance of the place even in the days of
the emperor Hadrian.</p>

<p class='c000'>No account has come down to us of the state of
Newcastle in the days of Roman occupation, but if,
after it had been deprived of the advantages which
the residence of the mural garrison conferred upon
it, the venerable Bede calls it 'an illustrious royal
city'—'<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>vico regis illustri</em></span>'—we must conclude that it
was a place of considerable importance. The natural
advantages of the situation struck the eye of Camden;
‘Now’, says he, ‘where the Wall and Tine almost
meet together, Newcastle sheweth itself gloriously
the very eye of all the townes in these parts.’</p>

<p class='c000'>Under these circumstances, there seems to be no
reason why the walls of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='sc'>Pons Ælii</span></span> should form the
usual military parallelogram any more than Roman
Rochester, or Pompeii, or Rome itself, much less
that the station should occupy an area of little more
than three acres.</p>

<p class='c000'>The contour of the ground on which the modern
Newcastle stands, is peculiar. It consists of three
tongues of land, separated by natural valleys permeated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>by rivulets. The westernmost of these presents
the boldest front to the river, and is that on
which the Castle stands; the Skinner-burn bounds it
on the west, and the valley of the Lort-burn, the present
Dean-street, on the east. The contiguous tongue
lies between the Lort-burn and Pandon-dean; and
that still further removed, has for its eastern boundary
the Ouse-burn. The same natural advantages which
recommended the heights of the most westerly of these
strips of ground to the Normans for the erection of their
stronghold, would no doubt previously induce the Romans
to select it as their chief position. They probably
enclosed nearly the whole of it within their walls.
Horsley, indeed, places his camp in this division, but
in the least advantageous part of it, whether considered
in a military or in a commercial point of view. The
Romans would surely not overlook the importance
of the ravine of Dean-street as a defence on the east,
especially at a time when the tide flowed up it as far
as the Painter-heugh, and of the cliff that descends
from the Castle to the river on the south. The necessity
of defending the bridge, and commanding the
Tyne would not be forgotten. Taking all these
things into account, we may fairly suppose the walls
of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='sc'>Pons Ælii</span></span> to have been thus defined:—The
Wall, passing through the site of St. Nicholas’-church,
would, of course, be its northern boundary;
a line coming from the church, and adapting itself
to the crest of the hill that overhangs Dean-street,
crossing the Head-of-the-Side and stretching as far
as the elevated angle on which the County-courts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>now stand, will probably mark its eastern boundary;
the southern rampart would run from this angle along
the edge of the cliff overhanging the Close, as far
as the site of the White-friar-tower, which stood
at the head of the present Hanover-street; the
western wall may have run in the line of the Town-wall
as far as Neville-tower, and then have struck
up in a straight line to meet the great Wall. Westward
of this boundary, the ground slopes down to
the Skinner-burn. If these lines are correctly
drawn, Roman Newcastle would contain upwards of
sixteen acres.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although the camp of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='sc'>Pons Ælii</span></span> occupied this
tongue of land, there is no reason to suppose that
suburban buildings were not erected on the other
two, both of which are well protected by their natural
situation. There is good ground to believe that
Pandon, which was formerly a separate town from
Newcastle, and is seated on the middle strip, was
of Roman origin. Villas and gardens probably extended
as far as the Ouse-burn.</p>

<p class='c000'>In order to render the preceding description intelligible
to persons unacquainted with the topography
of Newcastle, a plan of the town (<a href='#p126a'>Plate V</a>.)

<p class='c000'>Roman antiquities, which, when they abound, are
so serviceable in defining the seat of Roman occupation,
are unfortunately here rather scanty and unimportant.
This cannot be matter of surprise. In
the middle ages, Newcastle abounded in churches
and monastic buildings. To the erection of these
and of the Castle, the Town-wall, and Gates, every
stone whether lettered, sculptured, or plain, that
could easily be obtained, would be appropriated.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>PONS ÆLII.</div>

<p class='c000'>The precincts of the Castle have afforded the most
important discoveries of this kind. The present
County-courts occupy the site of a building which
used to be called the Half-moon-battery. This was
probably the position of the south-east angle of the
station of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='sc'>Pons Ælii</span></span>, and some of the lines of the
octagonal face of the battery presented no doubt the
actual curve of the station. To a certain extent the
Norman builders may have converted to their own
uses a portion of the labours of their imperial predecessors;
appearances seemed to shew that the Castle
wall between the Half-moon-battery and the Black-gate
had rested upon a Roman foundation. When
the County-courts were built, some important discoveries
were made. Mr. Hodgson, who watched the progress
of the excavations, has thus described them:—</p>

<p class='c014'>In digging for the foundations for the Northumberland
County Court-house, in 1810, a well was found finely cased
with Roman masonry. It still remains below the centre part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>of the present court-house. It had originally been a spring,
or sunk low down on the river bank, and its circular wall, raised
within another strong wall in the form of a trapezium to the
height of the area of the station, and the space between them
traversed with strong connecting beams of oak both horizontally
and perpendicularly, and then tightly packed up with
pure blue clay. Some beams of this timber were taken up and
formed into the judges’ seats, and chairs for the grand-jury
room, now in use. Two of the perpendicular beams had very
large stags’ horns at their lower end, apparently to assist in
steadying them till clay sufficient was put around them to
keep them upright. On the original slope of the bank next
the outer wall, there was a thick layer of ferns, grasses, brambles,
and twigs of birch and oak, closely matted together, and
evidently showing that before these works were constructed,
man had not tenanted the spot.<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c012'><sup>[61]</sup></a> Here also were exposed
large remains of the foundations of other very thick and strong
walls, one of which rose into the eastern wall of the Old Moot-hall,
which was of exactly the same breadth, bearing, and
style of building, and doubtless of the same date as the Roman
foundations of which it was a continuance.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>ANTIQUITIES OF PONS ÆLII.</div>

<p class='c014'>The whole site of the Court-house, for several feet above the
original surface of the earth, was strewn with a chaos of Roman
ruins. I was frequently on the spot while the excavations
were carrying on, and saw dug up large quantities of Roman
pottery, two bronze coins of Antoninus Pius, parts of the
shaft of a Corinthian pillar, fluted, and of the finest workmanship;
besides many millstones, and two altars, one bearing
an illegible inscription, and the other quite plain. The
altars were found near the north-east corner of the Court-house,
and near them a small axe, and a concave stone, which
bore marks of fire, was split, and had thin flakes of lead in its
fissures. The broad foundation walls were firm and impenetrable
as the hardest rock. On Aug. 11, 1812, when the foundations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>of the north portico were sinking, a Roman coin was
found (of what Emperor I have no minute,) and the original
surface of the ground was covered with a thick stratum of
small wood, some parts of which were wattled together in the
form of crates or the corfs of collieries, but in a decayed state,
and cut as easily with the workmen’s spades, as the brushwood
found in peat mosses does. As there was much horse or
mules’ dung near them, and some mules’ shoes amongst it, I
thought they had been fixed there as crates or racks to eat
fodder out of.</p>

<p class='c000'>Since that period, few important
discoveries have been
made. In cutting the crest
of the hill in front of the Castle
for one of the piers of the
Railway viaduct, a small stone
figure of Mercury, represented
in the adjoining wood-cut,<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c012'><sup>[62]</sup></a>
was found. It is preserved,
among other antiquities, in
the Museum in the Castle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Between the years 1840 and 1844, the White-friar-tower
and the contiguous portions of the Town-wall
of Newcastle were removed. Two Roman
altars were discovered, which are now in the possession
of the Society of Antiquaries, Newcastle-upon-Tyne.
One of them is destitute of an inscription,
and the other seems to bear the word <span class='fss'>SILVANO</span>.
Several coins of the Roman and mediæval age were
picked up in its immediate vicinity. The Roman
coins were of both the upper and the lower empire.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>From the manner in which the pieces of the
middle and ancient periods were commingled, a
thing of rare occurrence, it may be inferred that the
tower was formed out of Roman materials, and that
the Roman coins were re-imbedded without being
noticed, whilst the workmen inadvertently added
Nuremberg tokens and other contemporary pieces
to the numismatic treasures of the spot.</p>

<p class='c000'>But, perhaps, the structure which gave name to
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='sc'>Pons Ælii</span></span> affords the most interesting foot-prints
of Roman occupation in Newcastle.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE BRIDGE OF ÆLIUS.</div>

<p class='c000'>Horsley received sufficient evidence to convince
him, that a Roman road had gone from the south
bank of the Tyne to Chester-le-street, and thence
to the south of England. A bridge was necessary to
conduct the road across the river. In 1771, a flood
having carried away several of the arches of the
bridge which then existed, and materially damaged
the rest of the structure, it was found necessary to
erect a new one. In removing the old piers the distinguishing
characteristics of Roman masonry were
observed; and the workmen were led to believe that
the arches of the mediæval structure had been
placed upon the foundations which Hadrian laid.
Several piles of fine black oak, which had supported
the foundation, were drawn out of the bed of the river,
and found to be in a state of excellent preservation.<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c012'><sup>[63]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>COINS FOUND IN THE BRIDGE.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>The coins that were found imbedded in the piers
give decided evidence of the Roman origin of the
structure. To some of these, in the possession of
George Rippon, esq., of Waterville, North Shields,
I have had access; they are here represented.</p>

<p class='c000'>The coins of Hadrian are remarkably bold and sharp,
and cannot have been long in circulation before being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>deposited in the bed where sixteen centuries of repose
awaited them; that of Severus is a good deal corroded.
Besides these, other coins have been found. Brand
had one of Trajan, and he engraves a copper
coin of Hadrian; he also had in his possession
one of Antoninus Pius. Pennant describes, amongst
others, a coin of Faustina the Elder, and one of
Lucius Verus. Hodgson saw coins of Gordian and
Magnentius, all of which had been obtained from the
same spot.</p>

<p class='c000'>The coins posterior to the time of Hadrian were
probably deposited during the repairs and alterations
which the bridge received after its original construction
in A.D. 120.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>CHARACTER OF THE BRIDGE.</div>

<p class='c000'>It is probable that the ancient bridge had no stone
arches, but was provided with a horizontal road-way
of timber. Pennant<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c012'><sup>[64]</sup></a> who derived his information
from the workmen, says, that ‘the old piers seem
originally to have been formed without any springs
for arches. This was a manner of building used by the
Romans; witness the bridge built over the Danube by
Trajan, at Severin, whose piers, I believe, still exist.’</p>

<p class='c000'>The foundations of the piers of three Roman
bridges in the region of the Wall, still remain—one
across the Tyne, at <span class='sc'>Corstopitum</span>, one across the
North Tyne, at <span class='sc'>Cilurnum</span>, and another across the
Reed-water, at <span class='sc'>Habitancum</span>; an examination of
these has induced me to believe that they, at least,
had no arches. The piers are of a size and strength
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>sufficient to withstand the thrust of the waters
without the aid of an arch; and in one at least
of these cases, the requisite spring of the arch
would have raised the road to an inconvenient
height. An experienced mason who examined
carefully the ruins of the bridge at <span class='sc'>Habitancum</span>
told me that he observed that all the stones which encumbered
the spot were square, none of them having
the shape of stones used in building arches. It is
certain that in the mediæval period the Newcastle
bridge had a road-way of timber; for Matthew of
Paris tells us that, A.D. 1248, it, and the greater
part of the town were destroyed by fire.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>SUPPOSED MEDAL OF THE BRIDGE.</div>

<p class='c000'>Brand, misled by the early numismatists, conceived
that the bridge across the Tyne had been honoured
by a commemorative medal. He says—</p>

<p class='c014'>Two coins appear to have been struck upon the building of
two bridges by this emperor; one is doubtless to be referred
to that of Rome; may not the other have been intended to
commemorate the work we are now considering? One of the
bridges marked on these coins has seven, the other five arches.
The Tiber being a very inconsiderable river, when compared
with the Tyne, we must therefore claim that with seven
arches—especially as we find a view of the Pons Ælius at
Rome in Piranesi’s collection, without the modern ornaments,
where it is represented as consisting of exactly five arches.<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c012'><sup>[65]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Alas! for a theory so beautiful and so grateful
to the feelings of Newcastle antiquaries! Mr.
Akerman, in his work on rare and inedited Roman
coins, has pronounced the relentless verdict—‘The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>medallion with the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Pont Ælius</em></span>, quoted by
the early numismatic writers, is a modern fabrication.’</p>

<p class='c000'>It is perhaps too much to suppose that all the
arches of the mediæval bridge rested upon Roman
foundations, but it is more than probable that the
piers of the original structure would be at least as
numerous as those of its successor. The mediæval
bridge had twelve arches.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>ORIGIN OF THE NAME PONS ÆLII.</div>

<p class='c000'>No altar or other inscribed stone has been found
to confirm the opinion that Newcastle was the
ancient <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='sc'>Pons Ælii</span></span>. Brand was ‘of opinion that the
inscriptions belonging to the station of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='sc'>Pons Ælii</span></span>
are all built up in the old keep of the Castle, and
that a rich treasure of this kind will some time or
other be discovered, lurking in its almost impregnable
walls, by future antiquaries.’ May the antiquary
never be born that shall behold this treasure!
Such evidence is, however, scarcely needed to lead
us to the ancient designation of the place. The fact
that <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='sc'>Pons Ælii</span></span> occurs in the Notitia between
<span class='sc'>Segedunum</span> and <span class='sc'>Condercum</span>, and that Newcastle
lies between the modern representatives of these
two stations, Wallsend and Benwell, is strong presumption
in favour of the theory, and the fact that
a Roman bridge here crossed the Tyne, renders
it almost indubitable. This structure took the name of
the Bridge of Ælius, after Hadrian,<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c012'><sup>[66]</sup></a> who was of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>Ælian family, and the bridge gave name to the
station. The Notitia informs us that <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='sc'>Pons Ælii</span></span>
was governed by the tribune of the cohort of the
Cornovii, ‘a people,’ says Hodgson, ‘whose name is
unnoticed by all the ancient geographers I have
access to.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE CASTLE OF NEWCASTLE-UPON-TYNE.</div>

<p class='c000'>Before leaving the station of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='sc'>Pons Ælii</span></span>, a reference
to the mediæval structure—the Norman keep—which
gives the town its modern name, may be allowed.
It is the most perfect specimen of Norman
castrametation in the kingdom; and a careful examination
of its structure will yield a more correct
view of the mode of warfare adopted at the time of
its erection, and of the mournful condition of society
then existing, than the fullest verbal description could
give. Within a recent period its passages have
been cleared and its portals opened, so as to afford the
antiquary an opportunity of examining it thoroughly.
The Corporation of Newcastle, whose property it is,
have, in this respect, set an example which might
with advantage be followed by the national government.
To the student of the Wall, however, the collection
of Roman antiquities which the castle contains,
will be the object of greatest interest. In the
number and importance of its altars and inscribed
stones, it excels every other museum in Britain. As
the Castle contains so many of the spoils of the Wall,
it is much to be wished that it could be made the depository
of all that have been discovered on the line.
Numerous individual objects of interest are scattered
over the country, and he who would examine them all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>must travel several hundred miles, and propitiate the
favour of many private gentlemen, as well as public
bodies. Documents illustrative of the history of a
country may be regarded as the property of the
country, so far at least, as to be made easily accessible
to all. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='sc'>Pons Ælii</span></span> is the fitting place to deposit those
antiquities of the Wall which cannot be carefully
preserved on the spot where the Romans originally
placed them.</p>

<div class='sidenote c015'>ROAD TO BENWELL.</div>

<p class='c000'>The reader will probably now be glad to disentangle
himself from the intricacies of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='sc'>Pons Ælii</span></span>,
and to pursue with rapid steps the course of the
Wall westward.</p>

<p class='c000'>Between Newcastle and Benwell-hill, the traces
of the works are faint but interesting. The turnpike
road runs upon the bed of the prostrate Wall, so
that, except occasionally in a neighbouring building,
not one stone of it is to be seen; its constant companion,
the north fosse, may, however, be recognized
in a kind of depression or slack, which runs nearly
all the way parallel with the road on the traveller’s
right hand. On his left, he will sometimes be able
to discern with tolerable certainty the course of the
Vallum. A small, but well defined portion of it, is
met with immediately after leaving the town, behind
a row of houses, appropriately termed Adrianople.
Though the stone wall has perished, this humble
earth-work has survived the accidents of seventeen
eventful centuries! Its days, however, are now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>numbered; a contiguous quarry is making rapid
encroachments upon it.</p>

<div class='sidenote c015'>CONDERCUM.</div>
<p class='c000'>CONDERCUM.—About two miles from Newcastle,
and near the modern village of Benwell,
stood the third station of the line, <span class='sc'>Condercum</span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The present turnpike road runs through it, occupying,
in all probability, very nearly the site of its
ancient <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>via principalis</em></span>. So feeble, however, are the
traces of it which remain, that the wayfarer who
does not scrutinize the spot very narrowly, will pass
on his journey without knowing that he is treading
ground once jealously guarded by imperial power—the
scene, for centuries, of a crowded city’s joys and
fears.</p>

<p class='c000'>The situation of the camp is good; without being
much exposed, it commands an extensive prospect
in every direction. Northwards, looking over the
grounds of Fenham, the Simonside hills appear in
the distance, and still more remote, is the lofty
range of Cheviot. To the south is the vale of
Ravensworth, which is exceeded by the vale of
Clwyd only in magnitude, not in beauty, and to
the south-west, the lordly Tyne threads its way
through the richest of landscapes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sunny slope, south of the station, was favourable
for the erection of the suburban buildings of
the occupants of the camp, the foundations of several
having been discovered.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Horsley’s days, the ramparts were large and
distinct; now, their surface is chiefly marked by a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>general elevation, occasioned probably by the accumulated
ruins of the ancient fort. It contains in
all a space of nearly five acres. Gordon conceived
that the Wall was continued right through the station.
This would have divided it into two distinct
parts. As Horsley and Brand prove, the Wall
came up to its eastern and western ramparts, but
did not pass through it. The northern wall of the
station itself was a sufficient defence in that quarter.
About a third of the station was to the north of the
line of the Wall, the remaining two-thirds were
within it. The Vallum, Horsley tells us, fell in with
the southern rampart.</p>

<p class='c000'>The portion north of the turnpike road is at present
under tillage. In Brand’s days it was covered
with a plantation. The man who first ploughed it
told me that in doing so, his horse, on one occasion,
sank up to its middle in traversing some chambers
that had been insecurely covered. The quantity of
Roman pottery which is found in this portion of the
camp is remarkable. Fragments may be seen at
every step. The peculiar character of the Roman
earthenware, especially of the coral-coloured kind,
denominated Samian, renders this an interesting evidence
of Roman occupation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The larger portion of the station, that to the south
of the road, is enclosed within the walls of Benwell-park.
The inequalities of its grassy surface indicate
the lines of its streets, and the position of some of
its principal buildings. Near its centre is a large
mound, which would probably reward examination.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>The southern rampart, with its fosse, is very distinct.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>BENWELL.</div>

<p class='c000'>Two hypocausts have been discovered in connexion
with this station; one within its walls, close
to the south side of the road, and between forty and
fifty yards from the eastern rampart, the other without
them, and about three hundred yards to the
south-west. Of the latter building a plan is given
by Brand. It contained eight or nine apartments,
five of which had floors supported upon pillars. The
floors consisted of ‘flags covered with a composition
of various hard ingredients, about eighteen inches
thick, such as small pieces of brick and blue and red
pots, mixed up with run lime.’ The pillars were all
of stone, and were so arranged as to allow hot air to
circulate beneath the apartments. The idea generally
entertained of these arrangements is, that they
were intended for hot baths and sudatories. In
pursuance of this opinion, Mr. Shafto, who discovered
this hypocaust, says: ‘Here were found
many square bricks with holes in the middle, which
were probably joined together by way of pipes, to
conduct the water from the top of the hill, where
there was also the appearance of other baths, and
where, probably, springs had been, but since drained
by the colliery.’ However much the Romans in their
own luxurious city may have been addicted to the indulgence
of the hot-bath and the sweating-room, it
may well be doubted, whether, in this cold climate,
they would have any great desire for it, or if they had,
whether the dread realities of war would allow them
to make, on an enemy’s frontier, erections so extensive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>as this has been, for such a purpose. Next to
food, warmth would be their most urgent demand,
and a more effectual mode of maintaining a uniform
temperature in their dwellings could not be devised
than that which the hypocaust supplied.</p>

<img src='images/i_p140.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Brand tells us that great conduits or sewers, composed
of large wrought stones, were discovered in
the north part of the station at the depth of about a
yard and a half.</p>

<p class='c000'>Several inscribed slabs and small altars have
been found in the
station. The most
important one of
these, which is preserved
in the parsonage
at Ryton, is
here represented.
By comparing it
with the Notitia,
we learn the ancient name of the station, and the locality
of its original occupants.</p>

reads Ast<em>u</em>rum, not Ast<em>o</em>rum. At two other stations
the same people resided; at <span class='sc'>Cilurnum</span>, the Notitia
places the præfect ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>alæ secundæ Astorum</em></span>,’ and at
Æsica, the tribune ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>cohortis primæ Astorum</em></span>.’ At
both these forts, as well as in the case immediately
before us, inscriptions have been found which are
written Ast<em>u</em>rum; the probability, therefore, is, that
a clerical error has crept into the Notitia, and that it
was the Astures, not the Asti (a people of Liguria),
who garrisoned these posts. The Astures were
a people from the eastern part of the modern
Asturias, in Spain. 'Under the empire, the term
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>ala</em></span> was applied to regiments of horse, raised,
it would seem, with very few exceptions, in the
provinces.'<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c012'><sup>[67]</sup></a> This fractured slab, therefore, furnishes
us with the information that the camp at Benwell
was anciently named <span class='sc'>Condercum</span>, and that it
was garrisoned by a Spanish cavalry regiment. It
supplies other facts. This regiment was styled,
probably on account of some illustrious achievement,
Gordiana. The emperor Gordian, from whom this
title is derived, began his reign in the year 238. We
have thus a proof of the continued occupation of the
camp until a date subsequent to this period. The
event recorded by the inscription is to the same
effect. A temple which had been erected, probably
at the first formation of the station, had through time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>or the chances of war, become so entirely dilapidated,
as to require rebuilding, and Titus Agrippa accomplished
the work. The Romans, although they
had at this time been long in the occupation of the
isthmus, had then no thoughts of relinquishing it.
The woodland deities, to whom the temple was
dedicated, will require separate discussion afterwards.</p>

at this station. Two

were found here, may at once be
disposed of. They are dedicated
to one of the favourite deities of
Rome—Mars. The focus, or place
for burning the offering, is deep
and well marked in each of them.
They are small domestic altars,
before which the soldier would
perform his private devotions. As such, they give
us a little insight into the heart and feelings of the
worshipper.</p>

<span id='p143' class='figright id022'><img src='images/i_p143.jpg' alt='Altar to Mars' class='ig001' /></span>As the fruit to which it bears a resemblance could not
be known in Europe until after the

I am disposed to think it is
of Mithraic origin, and that the prototype
of it was a mass of flame
proceeding from the torch usually
represented in the statues of that
deity. The other altar, here given, is inscribed—</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides these and some other inscribed stones, many
coins have been found here; amongst them, Brand
mentions denarii of Trajan, Hadrian, Faustina senior,
and Domitian; brass coins of Valentinian, Gratianus,
Diocletian, Faustina, and Maxentius, with many
others not legible. Obscene figures are frequently
found in Roman stations. They were worn by
females as a religious charm. Benwell has furnished
one such example of a very remarkable
kind. Before leaving the station, the inquiring
traveller will do well to examine the stones of the
park-wall. He will soon detect many of Roman
mould, whose faces have been scarred by the blasts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>of many centuries. The larger ones have been derived
from the Wall—the smaller, from the curtain
wall of the station, or the dwellings erected within it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>CONDERCUM.</div>

<p class='c000'>The pleasant village of Benwell lies a little to the
south-west of the station. ‘The old tower of Benwell-hall,’
says Bourne, 'was the place where the
prior of Tynemouth resided some part of the summer,
and the chapel, which Mr. Shaftoe opens and
supplies for the good of the people of his village,
was the prior’s domestic chapel.' Who that visits
the spot will say that the prior who made the selection
was not a man of taste? Benwell, as Horsley
remarks, is not improbably thought to have its name
from the northern word <em>ben</em>, (Saxon <i>binnan</i>) signifying
within, and <em>well</em> for wall, as being seated
within, or on the south side of the Wall.<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c012'><sup>[69]</sup></a> Whitaker
derives the Roman name of the station, <span class='sc'>Condercum</span>,
from the Celtic <i>Cond ar gui</i>, the height upon the
water.<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c012'><sup>[70]</sup></a> The river being near, the description is
apposite.</p>

<p class='c004'>Leaving <span class='sc'>Condercum</span>, we again pursue our journey
westward. The road for several miles running upon
the base of the Wall, the facing stones may not unfrequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>be seen for some distance together, protruding
through the ‘metal.’ This used to be more
the case formerly than at present, for since the
diversion of the traffic from the road to the rail,
motives of economy have induced the road surveyors
to quarry, in some places, the last remnants of this
great work of antiquity, for materials with which to
repair the highway. The north fosse, as we pursue
our journey, becomes more distinct on the right of
the road.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE WALL AT DENTON.</div>

<p class='c000'>Descending Benwell-hill, the village of East Denton
is reached. Here we meet for the first time with
a fragment of the Wall. The accompanying wood-cut
exhibits its present state. William Hutton describes
the interesting relic with becoming reverence.</p>

<div id='p145'  class='figcenter id009'>
<img src='images/i_p145.jpg' alt='The Wall at East Denton' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c014'>At Denton Dean, situated at the bottom of Benwell-hill,
the great road veers a few yards to the right, that is into
Severus’ ditch, and gives us for the first time a sight of that
most venerable piece of antiquity, <span class='sc'>The Wall</span>, which is six
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>yards south of the road, and twenty short of the brook I am
going to pass. The fragment is thirty-six feet long, has three
courses of facing stones on one side, and four on the other,
and is exactly nine feet thick. An apple tree grows on the top.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has lost a course of facing-stones since Hutton
saw it, and the apple tree is but the shadow of what
it was.</p>

<p class='c000'>The turnpike road, which usually runs upon the
site of the Wall, uniformly swerves to the right when
passing a village. The truth is, nearly every house
and hamlet in the district has sprung out of the
Wall. In many instances a mile-castle, slightly
added to, has formed a mediæval dwelling of some
strength. The nucleus thus provided, became, in
the course of time, clustered round with contiguous
habitations, so that when, after the last season of
strife with which the borders were visited, the road
came to be constructed, motives of economy required
that these spots of increased value should be avoided.</p>

<p class='c000'>Beyond the burn, the ground again rises, and
the Wall, stretching onwards in a line with the
road, forms a distinct, but turf-covered mound.
At the distance of a field to the south of it, the Vallum
is seen in greater distinctness than before.
Both of the aggers and the intervening fosse may
be clearly made out. Some young ash-trees grow
in the ditch.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>DENTON HALL.</div>

<p class='c000'>Advancing a little further, we have Denton-hall,
formerly the seat of the literary Mrs. Montague, on
the right; attracted by her influence, many of the
great spirits of the age were occasionally found to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>be assembled within its walls. Very nearly opposite
the hall, a larger mass of ruin than usual betokens
the site of a mile-castle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ascending the hill from West Denton, the fosse
of the Murus is very distinctly seen. The road is
elevated two or three feet above the natural level of the
ground, the Wall, probably some courses high,
forming its nucleus.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the left hand, the lines of the Vallum are
feebly indicated, but by extending our glance some
distance backwards and forwards, we can, with
tolerable certainty, distinguish the artificial mounds
from the natural heavings of the surface.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>CHAPEL-HOUSE.</div>

<p class='c000'>Passing the fourth mile-stone, we arrive at Chapel-houses.
This name is of sufficiently frequent occurrence
along the line to suggest a momentary inquiry
into its origin. In the early ages of Christianity, a
mile-castle may have occasionally been the resort of
the worshippers of the true God; or in the ‘troublesome
times’ of border warfare, when the church
not unfrequently shared in the general devastation,
it may have been set apart as a place for the confirmation
of matrimonial vows, and for the performance
of religious rites.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the crown of this hill we have one of the
finest views which Northumberland can afford. The
Tyne, in all its glittering beauty, stretches far before
us. Its southern bank is crowned by the pretty
village of Ryton, its left is variegated with the once
beautiful, but now furnace-fuming, Wylam. An
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>amphitheatre of hills shuts in the distant scene.<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c012'><sup>[71]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Horsley describes some ruined ramparts, called
the Castle-steads near Chapel-houses, to the south of
both Vallum and Wall. They were probably temporary
encampments and have now disappeared.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>WALBOTTLE-DEAN.</div>

<p class='c000'>Before crossing Walbottle<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c012'><sup>[72]</sup></a>-dean, the Vallum,
which is very distinct, and the Wall (<em>i. e.</em> the road)
approach each other, apparently for mutual support.
There are no traces of a bridge across the ravine.</p>

<p class='c000'>As we ascend the next hill, and pass Throckley,<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c012'><sup>[73]</sup></a>
we have, for the most part, the fosse on the right
hand, and the mounds of the Vallum on the left,
very boldly developed. By the time the traveller
has advanced thus far, he will have learnt the necessity
of bearing in mind that he is in a mining district.
If he overlook this circumstance, he will be
in danger of mistaking the track of some old ‘waggon
way’ for the terraced lines of Roman cultivation, or
an old ‘pit-heap’ for an indubitable British barrow.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>After passing Throckley, just where a gate on the
left hand enters the field from the road, a mound
covered, in winter at least, with greener herbage
than the contiguous ground indicates the site of a
mile-castle. A little further on, a range of houses
of peculiar appearance, called the Frenchman’s-row,
attracts the eye. It was the residence, after the first
French revolution, of a number of refugees. The
dial which ornaments the Row is of their fabrication.
The building is now used as a poor-house.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>HEDDON-ON-THE-WALL.</div>

<p class='c000'>On the top of the little eminence, at which we
arrive before reaching Heddon-on-the-Wall, the
north fosse is deeper and bolder than it has hitherto
appeared; it must be nearly in its original perfection.
The works of the Vallum, about fifty yards to the
south, are also finely developed. The ditch, in both
cases, is cut through the free-stone rock. Here,
also, if the traveller will forsake the turnpike, for the
road, as usual, diverges to the right in order to avoid
the village, he may see a fragment of the Wall much
longer and somewhat higher than the one at Denton.
Its north face is destroyed, but about five courses of
the southern face are perfect. The accompanying
lithograph shews the present state of the Barrier here.
The Wall is in the foreground, while in the distance
(looking eastward) the section of the north fosse,
and of the works of the Vallum, is distinctly seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>About a mile north of the village is a striking
prominence called Heddon-law. Horsley remarks—‘Not
far from Heddon-on-the-Wall have been
some remarkable tumuli.’</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>The ditch of the Vallum cuts right through the
village, its lowest dip forming the village pond; it
is rather remarkable that in such a situation, it
should not long ago have been obliterated.</p>

<p class='c000'>Descending the hill on which Heddon-on-the-Wall
stands, the lines of the Barrier keep close
together, and not without reason. The crag on the
south, now the scene of extensive quarrying operations,
completely commands them. Surely a post
must have been maintained on this eminence in the
days of Roman occupation, though it had only been
for the sake of a look-out.</p>

<p class='c000'>Passing the eighth mile-stone, where the Vallum
is in good condition, we approach the fourth great
station of the Barrier. A road, crossing the turnpike
at right angles, is close to its east rampart.</p>

<div class='sidenote c015'>VINDOBALA.</div>

<p class='c000'>VINDOBALA.—The station now called Rutchester,
stands on flat ground, but commands a considerable
prospect. The Notitia places here the
tribune of the first cohort of the Frixagi, a people
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>RUTCHESTER.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
whose country does not seem to be mentioned by
any ancient geographer. The inside dimensions of
this station, from north to south, are 178 yards, and
from east to west, 135; it consequently contains
nearly five acres. The Wall started each way from
the north side of its east and west gates; so that a
a greater portion of the station lay on the north than
on the south side of it, as is shewn in the plan of it,
<a href='#p044b'>Plate II</a>. At present, the turnpike road runs between
these portions; that on the north has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>all ploughed, and three of its sides sloped into the
ditch; its general outlines may, however, be distinguished;
the southern part is irregular in its surface,
with heaps of ruins, still covered with sward.<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c012'><sup>[74]</sup></a>
In Horsley’s time, the northern part was sufficiently
perfect to enable him to discern six turrets in it,
'one at each corner, one at each side of the gate,
and one between each corner, and those adjoining
to the gate.'<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c012'><sup>[75]</sup></a> The Vallum seems to have joined
the station in a line with its southern rampart. The
ditch on the western side is still tolerably distinct.
The suburbs have been to the south of the station,
but their site has recently been disturbed by the
opening of an extensive quarry which has supplied
large quantities of the stone used in carrying the
railway over the Tyne, and through Newcastle.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the brow of the hill, just west of the station,
there is still to be seen, hewn out of the solid rock,
what Wallis calls a coffin. It has more the appearance
of a cistern. It is twelve feet long, four broad,
and two deep, and has a hole close to the bottom at
one end. When discovered, it had a partition of
masonry across it, three feet from one end, and contained
many decayed bones, teeth and vertebræ,
and an iron implement resembling a three-footed
candlestick. In the immediate vicinity of this spot,
three fine Roman altars were discovered in 1844;
they are now in the possession of Mr. James, of
Otterburn, and are described in the Archæologia
Æliana, iv. 5.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>VINDOBALA.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>The etymology of the name of this station seems
to be tolerably plain. ‘<span class='sc'>Vindobala</span>,’ says Whitaker,
‘signifies merely the fort upon the heights. <i>Bala</i>
remains, to the present period, the Welsh and Irish
appellation of a town.’ I have received a similar
account of the word from those acquainted with
the Gaelic language. The station, however, though
possessing the advantage of a gentle elevation
above the contiguous ground, does not stand upon
a lofty eminence.</p>

<p class='c000'>No inscriptions have been found here mentioning
the first cohort of the Frixagi, which, according to
the Notitia, was quartered in <span class='sc'>Vindobala</span>. This is
of little consequence; the names of the contiguous
stations both east and west having been ascertained,
the order of the stations in the Notitia is sufficient
evidence as to the identity of this with the ancient
<span class='sc'>Vindobala</span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The farm-house at Rutchester partly consists of
an ancient building, possessing great strength of
masonry. A gothic carving on the interior wall of
its principal apartment shews that it is not of Roman
construction. It was probably a mediæval stronghold,
made out of the ruins of the station. It contains
a well, now boarded over, which may be of
Roman date.</p>

<p class='c000'>Most of the stones of the farm buildings and
adjacent fences are Roman, and one or two fragments
of Roman inscriptions built up in the stables,
besides some small altars preserved on the premises,
give interest to the place.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>MURAL HOSPITALITY.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>Mr. Hutton is usually very particular in giving a
detail of the kind of entertainment he met with at
the various points of his journey. The recital of
his reception at Rutchester kindles into poetry:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c005'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I saw old Sir at dinner sit,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who ne'er said, "Stranger, take a bit,"</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet might, although a poet said it,</div>
      <div class='line'>Have saved his beef, and raised his credit.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>His own appearance, he tells us, was a little peculiar,
and archæological pursuits not being in vogue in
that day, the farmer probably had grave doubts as
to the propriety of tempting the enthusiastic old
man to prolong his stay.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has frequently been my lot to receive the kindly
attentions of the inhabitants of the mural region.
Often have my eyes, bedimmed with fatigue, been
‘enlightened’ by partaking of the barley cake of the
cottager, (excellent food for a thirsty climb) as well
as the costlier viands of the farm tenant, or proprietor.
Never shall I forget visiting, on one
occasion, a frail tenement near Chesterholm. Its
only inmate, an old woman, in the spirit of regal
hospitality, asked me to join with her in partaking
of her only luxury—her pipe. I recently observed
with regret, that the cottage was tenantless.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>NORTHUMBRIAN YEOMEN.</div>

<p class='c000'>The inhabitants of that part of the district which
is remote from towns, do not affect the dress, or the
speech, or the manners of polished citizens. They
like to know a person before they welcome him, and
make their approaches cautiously. But if slow in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>grasping the hand, they do it heartily and sincerely.
There is scarcely a latch in the wilder regions of the
country, that I would not freely lift in the assurance
of a smiling welcome. Often as I have groaned
under the toils to which my present undertaking
has exposed me, I have reason to rejoice, that the
Barrier of the Lower Isthmus has been the means
of making me acquainted with many of the true-hearted
and intelligent yeomen, both of my own
county, and of Cumberland, whom I should not
otherwise have known. Although their dialect may
sound strangely to a southern ear, yet it is English
in its native purity and strength; a great authority,
Mr. Thorpe, having said, 'I believe the genuine
Anglian dialect to be that which is usually denominated
the Northumbrian.'<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c012'><sup>[76]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Proceeding, now, after this long digression, on
our journey, we pass, on the left hand side of the
road, an inn generally called the Iron-sign. Some
of the buildings are entirely composed of Roman
stones. In the erection nearest the road are three
centurial stones. One has on it <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='fss'>COH VIII</span></span>, another
has the word <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='fss'>LVPI</span></span>, probably to announce the fact,
that the portion of the Wall in which it was originally
inserted had been built by the troop under the
command of the centurion Lupus; the third is illegible.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>HARLOW-HILL.</div>

<p class='c000'>Passing the ninth milestone, we stand upon the
top of an eminence from which there is a good view
of Harlow-hill, and of the adjacent country. The
Wall here slightly changes its course for the purpose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>of ascending the summit before it. The
Vallum keeps company with the Wall for a short
distance, but eventually swerves to the south with the
design of passing along the base of the hill; it
rejoins the Wall on the other side. This is an
arrangement which we should not have encountered
had the Vallum been intended for an independent
barrier against a northern foe. The north
fosse is here very distinct, forming a deep groove on
the left of the road all the way to Harlow-hill.</p>

<p class='c000'>Just before entering the village of Harlow-hill,
some portions of the heart of the Wall may be seen,
and a careful scrutiny will enable us to ascertain its
course through the village, a part of its foundation,
of the full width (nine feet), yet remaining.
As usual, in passing through the village, the turnpike
road leaves the Wall for a short distance. There
was a mile-castle at Harlow-hill, which, Horsley
says, had a high situation, and a large prospect; all
traces of it are now gone. A field, about half a mile
north of Harlow-hill, bears the ominous name of
Grave-riggs; the traditionary account of its origin
being, that after a bloody battle in ‘the troublesome
times,’ it became the resting-place of slaughtered
multitudes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The village and ancient stronghold of Welton (a
corruption no doubt of Wall-town) is about half a
mile to the south of the road. The fortlet is
entirely built of Roman stones. The adjoining
mansion, at present occupied by the farm tenant,
bears the date of 1616. Its large hall, with ample
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>hearth and spacious bow-windows, is redolent of
ancient hospitality. In the memory of the villagers,
the freaks of a benevolent ghost, named Silky, which
frequented the old tower, and the feats of strength
performed by William of Welton, still survive the
weekly intrusion of the newspaper.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>WALL-HOUSES.</div>

<p class='c000'>At Wall-houses, on the south side of the road,
traces of a mile-castle are obscurely visible; between
this point and the fourteenth mile-stone all the lines
of the Barrier are developed in a degree that is quite
inspiriting. The north fosse is, for a considerable
distance, planted with trees, which will for some time
save it from the envious plough.</p>

</div>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'>THE VALLUM AT DOWN-HILL.</div>

<p class='c000'>Immediately after passing the farm house of Carr-hill,
an appearance of great interest presents itself.
The works of the Vallum are coming boldly forward
in company with the Wall, when suddenly, and at
a decided angle, they change their course, evidently
to avoid mounting a small barrow-like elevation,
called Down-hill.<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c012'><sup>[77]</sup></a> The Wall pursues its course
straightforward. The view, exhibited on the opposite
page, taken from the edge of the hill, looking
eastward, shews this arrangement. The road, with
the ditch on its north side, is the representative
of the Wall. The Vallum and Wall again converge
as they approach <span class='sc'>Hunnum</span>. These appearances
strongly corroborate the opinion that all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>lines of the Barrier are but parts of one great engineering
scheme. If the Vallum had been constructed
as an independent defence against a northern
foe, and nearly a century before the Wall, we cannot
conceive that an elevation, which so entirely commands
the Vallum, would have been left open to the
enemy; especially as it would have been just as easy
to take the Vallum along the north flank of the
hill as along the south. Horsley, who advocates the
opinion that the north agger is Agricola’s Military
Way, that the southern aggers were the work of
Hadrian, and that the Wall was not erected till the
time of Severus, is rather at a loss to account for
these appearances. He says:—</p>

<p class='c014'>Before we come to Halton-chesters, somewhat appears that
is pretty remarkable. Hadrian’s Vallum running full upon a
little hill, turns at once round about the skirt of it, leaving
the hill on the north, and thereby, one would think, rendering
the Vallum itself a weak defence at that part. The north
agger goes close to the south side of this hill; so that they
were also obliged to carry the Vallum round the hill in order
to preserve the parallelism. If the north agger was the Old
Military Way, and prior to the Vallum, there was nothing improper
in carrying it on the south skirts of the hill; and then
when the Vallum came afterwards to be built, (for a defence,
or place of retreat) they were under a kind of necessity to
form it after this manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>Since so able a man as Horsley can devise no
better defence of his theory, it may well be abandoned
altogether. It cannot be conceived that,
under a rule so vigorous as Hadrian’s, the builders
of the Barrier would be allowed to give the enemy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>a material advantage, in order to save themselves
the trouble of reconstructing the Military Way for
a short space.</p>

<p class='c000'>Down-hill bears marks of having been quarried at
some distant period for its limestone. A little to
the south of the Vallum are some circular lines,
which an experienced observer tells me, are the
remains of ‘sow-kilns.’ It would, perhaps, be rash
to claim for them a primeval date, though in their
appearance there is nothing inconsistent with the
supposition.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>HALTON RED-HOUSE.</div>

<p class='c000'>Halton Red-house is next passed on the right
hand. It is entirely built of stones taken from the
neighbouring station; they have, however, been
fresh dressed. In the farm-yard is a rectangular
stone trough, which was found in the station, and
which its owner describes as a ‘smiddy trow,’ and
shews upon the edge the place which had been worn
away by the attrition of the blacksmith’s irons. It
might, indeed, serve very well for such a purpose,
but troughs of this kind are of too frequent occurrence
in the buildings along the line to allow us to
suppose that this was their usual application. They
are generally very rudely carved both outside and
in, and not unfrequently are formed of an irregular
unsquared block of stone. I think that they were
used for domestic and culinary purposes. There is
a fragment of one lying in the hypocaust at Chesters,
the edge of which is worn down by the sharpening
of knives upon it.</p>

<p class='c000'>We now approach the fifth station of the line,</p>

<div class='sidenote c015'>Hunnum.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>HUNNUM.—This ancient abode of Rome’s warriors,
with its walls, streets, temples, markets, and
aqueducts, is nearly one unbroken sweep of luxuriant
vegetation. The traveller may readily pass by it,
as Hutton did, without discerning symptoms of
Roman occupation. A small, half-ruined hut stands
within its area, a fitting emblem of the surrounding
desolation. It is almost needless to name a city,
which has no existence, but for convenience sake,<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>HALTON-CHESTERS.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Horsley conferred upon it the style and title of Halton-chesters.
The castle of Halton is close by.</p>

<p class='c000'>The form of the station is peculiar, as is shewn in
the plan of it, <a href='#p044b'>Plate II</a>. The Wall joins the station
at about one-third the distance between its northern
and southern extremity. The portion of the station
which is to the north of the Wall is not so broad as
the part to the south of it. The only reason which
has been assigned for this is, that, as Horsley observes,
'there is a descent or hollow ground joining
to the west side of this part, so that the work could not
be carried on any farther that way without much
trouble and expense; though, it must be owned, the
Romans don't usually seem to have valued either the
one or the other'. It is remarkable that in adapting
the station to the ground, they have not given
to the wall, at the north east corner, a slanting
direction, as would have been most convenient, but
have, as usual, adhered to the rectangular form.</p>

<p class='c000'>The turnpike road, keeping the line of the Wall,
crosses the station from the site of the eastern to
that of the western gateway. The section north of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>the road was brought under cultivation about twenty
years ago, when immense quantities of stones were
removed. It is now called the ‘Brunt-ha’penny
field’ in consequence of the number of corroded
copper coins which were found in it. The portion
south of the road has a gentle slope and a fair exposure
to the sun. It has not recently been ploughed,
and consequently exhibits, with considerable distinctness,
the lines of the outer entrenchments and ditches,
as well as the contour of the ruined buildings and
streets of the interior. The suburbs have covered
a fine tract of pasture-ground to the south. The
valley on the west side of the station would materially
strengthen the position in this quarter.</p>

<p class='c000'>The excavations made in the northern section, a
few years ago, revealed several points of interest.
The careful manner in which the stones, even of the
foundation, were squared and chiselled, struck beholders
with surprise. The thickness, of one part
at least, of the west wall of the station I have been
assured, by a person who superintended the work,
was nine feet.<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c012'><sup>[78]</sup></a> In the angle of the north-west
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>portion of the station, just outside the Wall, was a
large heap, containing numerous fragments of Roman
pottery, the bones of animals, the horns of deer, and
other refuse matter—it must, in short, have been
the dung-hill of the camp. Even now, although the
plough has passed repeatedly over it, its position is
shewn by the darkness of the soil. On the same
occasion, there was laid open an aqueduct of about
three quarters of a mile in length, which seems to
have conducted water from a spring or burn in the
high ground north of the place where Stagshawbank
fair is held. My informant, who traced it for between
two and three hundred yards, says, that it was
formed of stone, and was covered with flags.<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c012'><sup>[79]</sup></a> In
crossing the valley to the west of the fort, it must
have been supported on pillars, or a mound. The
most remarkable circumstance to be noticed respecting
this water-course is, that it was on the
north, or the enemy’s side of the Wall. It is
scarcely probable that the Romans would depend for
that portion of their daily supply, which was required
for drinking and culinary purposes, on so precarious
a source; but it is not unlikely that the water
so introduced was meant to fill the fosse to the north
of the station, and thus to give the additional security
of a wet ditch to a portion of the camp, which,
though much exposed, possessed no natural strength
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>of situation.<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c012'><sup>[80]</sup></a> Crossing the station diagonally from
below the eastern gateway to the north-west angle,
a sewer or drain was found, of considerable dimensions.
My informant crept along it for about one
hundred yards. The bottom of it was filled with
hardened mud, imbedded in which, were found a lamp
and many bone pins, such as those with which the
Romans fastened their woollen garments.</p>

<p class='c000'>The most interesting discovery made on this occasion,
however, was a suite of apartments, which
have been usually supposed to be ‘the Baths.’ The
building was one hundred and thirty-two feet in
length, and contained not fewer than eleven rooms.
The first of these was forty-three feet long, and twenty
wide, and was the place, it has been conjectured,
‘where the bathers waited, and employed themselves
in walking and talking, till their turn came to bathe.’
The others beyond are supposed to have been set
apart for the purposes of undressing, taking the cold,
the tepid, and the hot-bath, sweating, anointing, and
robing. If the Roman prefects allowed the most
important buildings of their frontier camps to be
devoted to the enjoyment of the bath in all its elaborate
details, they were more indulgent than some
modern generals would be. That one or two of the
smaller rooms have been devoted to ablution is not
unlikely, this range of buildings having contained two
carefully constructed cisterns which may have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>used as baths. Several of the rooms had hanging
floors, with flues beneath; pipes of burnt clay, fixed
to the walls by T-headed holdfasts, communicated
with the flues below, and conveyed the hot air up
the sides of the apartments. But no provision for
heating large quantities of water was discovered,
such as we might have expected to find, if the whole
building had been used for bathing.</p>

<p class='c000'>The whole of this interesting structure was
removed as the process of exhumation proceeded.
Our only consolation is, that a minute and able
description of it has been left us by Mr. Hodgson.</p>

<div id='p163'  class='figcenter id023'>
<img src='images/i_p163.jpg' alt='The Works near Carr-hill' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Several inscribed and sculptured stones have been
discovered here. Camden, in 1600, found a monumental
slab, erected to the memory of a soldier of
the Ala Sabiniana; the regiment which the Notitia
represents as being quartered at <span class='sc'>Hunnum</span>. A
stone, bearing
the inscription,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='fss'>LEG. II.
AVG. F.</span>, <em>Legio
secunda Augusta
fecit</em></span>, is at
Alnwick castle,
and belongs, I
think, to this
station. Wallis says 'as some labourers were turning
up the foundations here, for the sake of the
stones to mend the road, they met with a centurial
stone with the above inscription, within a civic garland,
the crest of the imperial eagle at each end,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>and that it was taken into the custody of Sir Edward
Blackett. The one here shewn, though not a centurial
stone, must be the one in question.<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c012'><sup>[81]</sup></a> It is one
of the most elegantly carved stones that have been
found upon the line, and closely resembles the style
of those erected by the same legion in the Barrier of
the Upper Isthmus. The ornament in the upper
margin, and at the sides, has probably formed the
type of one that prevailed in the Transition Norman
and Early English styles.</p>

<p class='c000'>Several busts of emperors and empresses, preserved
about the house and grounds of Matfen,
shew the attention which the ancient inhabitants of
<span class='sc'>Hunnum</span> have paid to the decoration of the camp.</p>

<div id='p164'  class='figright id013'>
<img src='images/i_p164.jpg' alt='Slab—Fulgur Divom' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>A little to the west of
the station, not far from
the gateway, was recently
found the slab which
is here figured. Although
the inscription is
not deeply cut, it is very
legible, and doubtless means—The lightning of the
gods. When any spot was struck with lightning, it
was immediately deemed sacred, and venerated as
such by the Romans, being surrounded by a breastwork
of masonry, similar to that put round the mouth
of a well. Conscious guilt makes cowards of the most
dauntless warriors! Perhaps some member of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>Sabinian ala, hastening for shelter, and beseeching
meanwhile the protection of Jupiter Tonans, was
here arrested on life’s journey, and summoned to his
great account.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the minor antiquities found at this station
was a particularly massive finger ring of pure gold,
set with an artificial stone, on which a full-length
figure was engraved. It was stolen from lady
Blackett, to whom it belonged, together with the
rest of her jewellery.</p>

<p class='c000'>An intelligent observer informs me, that an ancient
road of Roman construction went direct north from
<span class='sc'>Hunnum</span>. It, no doubt, soon joined the eastern
branch of the Watling-street which Horsley lays
down, part of whose course is represented in the
map accompanying this volume.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>HALTON-CHESTERS.</div>

<p class='c000'>Halton-castle is to the south of the station. It is
entirely composed of stones taken from the Roman
Wall. In the farm-buildings attached to it, are some
Roman mouldings, and a weathered figure of primeval
aspect.</p>

<p class='c000'>No probable etymological account of the word
<span class='sc'>Hunnum</span> has yet been offered. If the word Halton
can be supposed to have any affinity with <span class='sc'>Hunnum</span>,
besides the initial breathing, this is one of the few
instances in which there is any resemblance between
the ancient and modern name of the stations.</p>

<p class='c004'>Leaving <span class='sc'>Hunnum</span>, we soon reach Stagshawbank-gate,
where the ancient Watling-street crosses
the road at right-angles. This Roman Way was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>probably first constructed by Agricola, as a means
of keeping up a communication with the garrisons
in South Britain, while he was forcing his way into
Scotland. A fort formerly stood here to guard the
passage through the Wall; no trace of it now
remains.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>VALLUM NEAR ST. OSWALD’S.</div>

<p class='c000'>The earth-works between this point and the crown
of the hill descending to the North Tyne are remarkably
perfect. The description which Hutton
gives of them happily holds good at the present
moment—</p>

<p class='c014'>I now travel over a large common, still upon the Wall,
with its trench nearly complete. But what was my surprise
when I beheld, thirty yards on my left, the united works of
Agricola and Hadrian, almost perfect! I climbed over a
stone wall to examine the wonder; measured the whole in
every direction; surveyed them with surprise, with delight;
was fascinated, and unable to proceed; forgot I was upon
a wild common, a stranger, and the evening approaching. I
had the grandest works under my eye of the greatest men of
the age in which they lived, and of the most eminent nation
then existing; all of which had suffered but little during the
long course of sixteen hundred years. Even hunger and
fatigue were lost in the grandeur before me. If a man writes
a book upon a turnpike road, he cannot be expected to move
quick; but, lost in astonishment, I was not able to move at all.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first time I visited the spot, this passage,
through which there runs so fine a vein of youthful
enthusiasm, was fresh in my recollection.
The shades of evening were beginning to gather
round me, and the blackness of the furze which
covered the ground, gave additional solemnity to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>scene. I looked for the venerable old man, as if
expecting still to find him fixed in his enthusiastic
trance; but he was not there. After all, he had
moved on; and a few years more removed him
from this scene, to sleep in the church-yard under
a humbler and less durable mound than his favourite
general and emperor had here raised!</p>

<p class='c000'>The section given in page 52, exhibits the state of
the works at this place. The north fosse is very
boldly developed between the sixteenth and
eighteenth milestone: the whole of its contents lie
strewed on its outer margin. Near the eighteenth
milestone, on the left of the road, is a mound, which
I take to be the remains of a mile-castle. In one
part near here, the Wall, as seen in the road,
measures ten feet wide, but it speedily becomes
narrower.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>ST. OSWALD’S CHAPEL.</div>

<p class='c000'>Where the ground begins to dip strongly to the
North Tyne, St. Oswald’s chapel stands. On the
north side of the road, is a field called Mould’s-close,
in which a number of bones and implements of war
have from time to time been turned up, and which
is supposed to be the site of a battle. The tradition
runs, that from the fight which was won here,
England dates her advancing greatness, and that,
from the fatal results of a conflict to be lost on the
same ground, she will date her decline. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>BATTLE OF HEAVEN-FIELD.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Hodgson
says, ‘Was this the site of part of the battle of
Heaven-field, which Bede says was fought just
north of the Roman Wall, and in memory of which
the chapel of St. Oswald was built?’ That it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>was, the narrative of the venerable historian will
probably shew—</p>

<p class='c014'>The place is shewn to this day, and held in much veneration,
where Oswald (A.D. 635), being about to engage (with
the ferocious British king Cadwalla), erected the sign of the
holy cross, and on his knees prayed to God that he would assist
his worshippers in their great distress. It is further reported,
that the cross being made in haste, and the hole dug
in which it was to be fixed, the king himself, full of faith, laid
hold of it, and held it with both his hands, till it was set fast
by throwing in the earth; and this done, raising his voice, he
cried to his army, ‘Let us all kneel, and jointly beseech the
true and living God Almighty, in his mercy, to defend us
from the haughty and fierce enemy; for He knows that we
have undertaken a just war for the safety of our nation.’ All
did as he had commanded, and accordingly advancing towards
the enemy with the first dawn of day, they obtained the victory,
as their faith deserved. In that place of prayer very
many miraculous cures are known to have been performed, as a
token and memorial of the king’s faith; for even to this day,
many are wont to cut off small chips of the wood of the holy
cross, which being put into water, men or cattle drinking of,
or sprinkled with that water, are immediately restored to
health. The place in the English tongue is called Hefenfeld,
or the Heavenly Field.... The same place is near the Wall
with which the Romans formerly enclosed the island from sea
to sea, to restrain the fury of the barbarous nations, as has
been said before. Hither, also, the brothers of the church of
Hagulstad (Hexham), which is not far from thence (it is in
the valley directly below), repair yearly on the day before that
on which king Oswald was afterwards slain, to watch there
for the health of his soul, and having sung many psalms, to
offer for him in the morning the sacrifice of the holy oblation.
And since that good custom has spread, they have lately
built and consecrated a church there, which has attached
additional sanctity and honour to that place.<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c012'><sup>[82]</sup></a></p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>A little to the south of the road, at St. Oswald’s-hill-head,
is Fallowfield-fell, where the Written-rock,
of which an engraving is given, page <a href='#p102'>102</a>, may
yet be seen. The face of the rock occupied by the
inscription is four feet long; the letters are distinct.<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c012'><sup>[83]</sup></a>
Continuing to descend the hill, we come to Plane-tree-field,
where on the left of the road, a conspicuous
piece of the Wall remains. It is about thirty-six
yards long, and has, in some places, five courses of
facing-stones entire; the grout of the interior which
rises still higher, gives root to some fine old thorns.
This sight may be rendered more interesting by the
antiquary’s carrying his eye forward, and tracing the
Wall in its onward course; in its modern representative,
the turnpike road, it is seen, (having crossed
the North Tyne, and passed the station of <span class='sc'>Cilurnum</span>,)
bounding up the opposite hill in its usual unflinching
manner, and making for the wastes and mountains
which it is speedily to traverse.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE WALL AT BRUNTON.</div>

<p class='c000'>In the grounds of Brunton, a little below this, a
small piece of the Wall is to be seen in a state of
very great perfection. It is seven feet high, and
presents nine courses of facing-stones entire. The
mortar of the five lower courses is good; the face
of the south side is gone. The ditch also is here well
developed. The opposite lithograph gives an accurate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>representation of what Hutton calls ‘this grand
exhibition.’ The altar which, at present, stands as
it is placed in the drawing, formerly discharged
the office of a gate-post at the entry of the yard of
St. Oswald’s chapel.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>BRIDGE OVER THE NORTH TYNE.</div>

<p class='c000'>For some reason, which it is hard to divine, the
turnpike road now recedes from the Wall, and crosses
the river at Chollerford, nearly half-a-mile above the
spot where the Roman bridge spanned it.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>The remains of this bridge may yet be seen when
the water is low, and the surface smooth. There
seem to have been three piers of considerable size and
solidity, set diagonally to the stream. The stones
composing them are large, regularly squared, and
fastened with metallic cramps.<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c012'><sup>[84]</sup></a> Luis-holes, indicating
the mode in which they have been lowered into
their bed, appear in several of them. The firmness
with which these foundation courses still retain the
position assigned to them by the soldiers of Hadrian
is very remarkable; the rolling floods of sixteen
hundred winters seem to have spent their rage upon
them almost in vain. As the eastern side of the river
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>is frequently overflowed, the Vallum is here obliterated,
but probably both works approached the bridge
in close companionship. On the western side, appearances
still bear out Horsley’s statement, that the
'Wall falls upon the middle of the fort, and Hadrian’s
Vallum, as usual, falls in with the south side of it.'</p>

<p class='c000'>A plan of <span class='sc'>Cilurnum</span>, and adjoining works, as figured
by Warburton, is given in <a href='#p044b'>Plate II</a>. Probably,
few who examine it attentively will question the justness
of the conclusion to which he has arrived, that
the Wall, Vallum, stations, castles, and turrets, ‘by
their mutual relation to one another, must have been
one entire, united defence, or fortification.’</p>

<p class='c000'>We are now arrived at the station called in the
locality, Chesters, but by Horsley named, for the
sake of distinction, Walwick-chesters. An attentive
examination of it will well reward the antiquary.</p>

<div class='sidenote c015'>CILURNUM.</div>
<p class='c000'>CILURNUM.—This station has, as usual, the
form of a parallelogram, the corners being slightly
rounded off. It contains an area of fully six acres.
In the latter part of the last century, when the mansion
and estate of Chesters came into the possession
of the family of Clayton, this area was covered with
the ruins of buildings which had apparently stood
in strait, narrow streets, and although the surface
of the station has since been levelled and made
smooth, in order to fit it for its use as part of
the park, yet its ramparts and fosse, the Wall
and Vallum as they approach and leave it, and
the road leading to the river, may all be distinctly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>discerned; even the ruined dwellings of the interior
area, as if dissatisfied with their lowly condition,
struggle to rear themselves into notice. A
portion of the Wall, near the north-west angle, has
been freed from the encumbering soil; it is five
feet thick, and exhibits four courses of masonry in
excellent preservation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hutchinson was struck with the linear character
which the ruined streets of this fort had in his time,
and was reminded, by their appearance, of the
arrangements of the Polybian camp. This will be
observed in a greater or less degree in all the stations,
and there cannot be a doubt but that the dwellings
were arranged in rows parallel to the four sides
of the stations, and hence, intersecting each other at
right angles. It was necessary that the Roman camp,
whether of a temporary or permanent character,
should be nearly uniform in its plan. If the troops
rested but for a night, each man knew the part he
had to fill in preparing the fortification, and could
set about it at once; in the event of a sudden attack
in the darkness of the night, each knew his
position, though he may never have rested upon
the spot before.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suburban buildings have occupied the space between
the station and the river, and ruins more
extensive than usual are spread over the ground to
the south. There is no appearance of any habitations
having been erected to the north of the Wall.
Whenever the surface of the contiguous ground is
broken, fragments of Samian ware and other marks
of Roman occupation appear.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>CHESTERS.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>Two remains of great interest are found within the
station. One of these is an underground vault near
the middle. Its masonry is rough, and somewhat
peculiar; the sides incline slightly inwards, but the
roof, instead of being uniformly vaulted, is formed
of three ribs arched in the usual manner, and the
intervals between them are in technical language—‘stepped
over,’ that is, the stones of each course are
made to project inwards a little, until, at length, one
laid on the top completes the junction. The woodcut,
which is here introduced, together with the following
extract from Hodgson’s description of it, will
give a tolerably correct idea of this curious structure.</p>

<div id='p173'  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_p173.jpg' alt='Vault at Cilurnum' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c014'>This vault, when it was first found, was supposed to have
been the Ærarium of the station. Between the joinings of
the floor, which were of thin free-stone flags, were found several
counterfeit denarii, both of copper and iron plated with silver.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>The approach to it was by four steps downwards, the lowest of
which was a large centurial stone, which had borne an inscription,
but nearly all of it had been purposely erased. On the
outside of the threshold was found, in a sadly decayed state,
its original door of wood, strongly sheathed with plates of
iron, and the whole firmly rivetted together with large square
nails. Within the door, which had opened inwards, the end
wall was two feet thick, plastered and painted. Its internal
area is ten feet by nine, and its height to the crown of the
arch six feet four inches.<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c012'><sup>[85]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Some buildings situated near to the spot where
the eastern gateway must be, and which have recently
been freed from the earth and rubbish that
have long enveloped them, are objects of still greater
interest. Their general appearance, as seen from a
slight elevation, is shewn in the adjoining wood-cut,
while, for a more minute knowledge of their size
and arrangements, reference may be made to the
plan on the opposite page. Eight apartments have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>already been exposed, and a little more research
would doubtless display others.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE HYPOCAUSTS.</div>

<p class='c000'>Descending a few steps (at L in the Plan), a
street three feet wide at one extremity, and four at
the other, is entered. Another, leading from it at
right-angles, and which is paved with flag-stones,
conducts to the grand entrance (D) of what appears
to be the principal section of the building.
The steps are very much worn down by the tread
of feet, and even some of the stones, which have
evidently been put in the place of others that
have been too much abraded to be serviceable,
exhibit partial wear. This saloon must have been
a place of general concourse—can it have been
the hall of justice, or the place where the commander
of the station transacted the business of the
district under his charge? The floor (E) is probably
supported on pillars, and has been warmed by
flues beneath; but this cannot be ascertained without
injuring it. The upper covering is of flags, the
fractured state of which induces the belief, that the
walls of the surrounding building have been forcibly
thrown down upon them. The northern enemies of
Rome, knowing the importance of these stations,
would not be slow in involving them in entire ruin,
when permitted, by the withdrawal of the troops, to
do so without molestation. Passages diverge from
this saloon, to the right and left, into other apartments.
In the room on the left was found, in
good preservation, a cistern or bath (C), lined with
red cement. A breach had been made in the street
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>wall of this chamber (at B), and in the rubbish which
<span id='p178' class='figright id015'><img src='images/i_p178.jpg' alt='River-god' class='ig001' /></span>encumbered the gap, was found the statue of a river-god,
of which a
correct sketch is
here given. It is
probably intended
to represent
the genius of the
neighbouring river—the
North
Tyne. Although
executed in coarse sand-stone, it is not without considerable
gracefulness of attitude and proportion. It is
preserved in the mansion at Chesters. Of the present
state of the apartments beyond, the wood-cut in the
previous page, and the lithograph here introduced, will
give an accurate conception. The floors have been
supported upon pillars, some of them being of stone,
others of square flat bricks. The stone pillars are,
for the most part, fragments of columns and balusters
which have been used in a prior structure.<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c012'><sup>[86]</sup></a> The
student of mediæval architecture will probably recognise
in some of them types of the Saxon style.
The dilapidated state of the floor of this apartment
allows of an easy examination of its mode of construction.
Flags, about two inches thick, rest upon
the pillars; a layer of compost, five inches thick, and
formed of lime, sand, gravel, and burned clay or
pounded tile, succeeds, and above that, another covering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>of thin flag-stones.<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c012'><sup>[87]</sup></a> This apartment has been
provided with a semicircular recess at its eastern extremity
(G), and, at the angle next the street (A), has
been supported by a buttress. A similar alcoved
recess existed on the western side of one of the
principal rooms of the ‘baths’ at <span class='sc'>Hunnum</span>, and the
same arrangement may yet be observed in the corresponding
building at Lanchester. All of these
buildings have been strengthened with buttresses,
but it is only in these and analogous cases, that the
use of the buttress is admitted among the erections
of the Barrier; it never occurs in the great Wall or
the curtain-walls of the stations. In the circular recess<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>THE HYPOCAUSTS.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
of this apartment is an aperture (G), which
probably has served to regulate the current of air
circulating in the hypocausts. The furnace which
warmed the suite of apartments was situated near
the south-east extremity of the building (at F); the
pillars near the fire having been much acted upon
by the heat, the whole of this part of the floor was
reduced, on exposure to the frosts of winter, to the
confused heap represented in the drawing. The
soot in the flues was found as fresh as if it had
been produced by fires lighted the day before.<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c012'><sup>[88]</sup></a>
The walls of this apartment were coated with plaster,
and coloured dark red; exposure to the weather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>soon stripped them of this covering. An arched
passage curiously turned with Roman tile took the
heated air from the furnace through the party-wall
(at X) into the chamber to the west of it. The
rooms to the westward of the intersecting street
(HD), seem to form an independent building, and
have less of the aspect of a place of public concourse
than the other portions. They may have
been the private residence of the commander of the
station. They, too, are heated by hypocausts.</p>

<p class='c000'>In urging the conviction, that the hanging floors
of these Roman buildings were meant to produce a
comfortable warmth, rather than to generate steam,
by having water sprinkled upon them, attention
may be drawn to the thickness of their substance.
At present, the floor of the principal apartment
is nine inches thick, and when its upper surface
was overlaid, as it no doubt was, with a tasteful
concrete or mosaic pavement, it would be an inch
or two more. It would require a very powerful furnace
to raise this mass of matter to a considerable
temperature. On the other hand, if the production
of a genial and uniform warmth were the object in
view, no contrivance could be more suitable. The
heated air from a small furnace permeating the underground
flues and the walls of a suite of apartments,
and not passing off until, in its lengthened
passage, it had given out the larger part of the
warmth it had derived, would, in the lapse of some
hours, give to the whole building a comfortable temperature,
which it would not readily lose. Any inattention
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>to the furnace, either by causing it to burn
too fiercely or too feebly, would not be felt. The
thickness of the floors would prevent the air from
being scorched, and producing that disagreeable sensation
which is experienced in rooms that are heated
by the stoves in common use. It is not improbable
that we may return to this method of warming our
churches and public halls, even if we do not adopt it in
our private buildings.<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c012'><sup>[89]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>METHOD OF WARMING BUILDINGS.</div>

<p class='c000'>The door-ways of some of these apartments have
been provided with double doors, probably for more
effectually maintaining the warmth of the room.</p>

<p class='c000'>The masonry of those portions of the walls which
are standing, is in an excellent state of preservation.
In the angle near the buttress (A), the action of
the trowel in giving the finishing touch to the
pointing may be perceived. The walls rest upon
two strong basement courses, the angle of the uppermost
being bevelled off with a neat moulding.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>Some of the quoins of the door-ways consist of very
large stones; one is six feet long, and is probably a
ton in weight. This proves that it was not from
lack of mechanical means that the interior buildings
and walls of the stations were composed of small
stones. More than one of the thresholds have a
groove very roughly cut in them, apparently to allow of
the egress of water. This has probably been done
after the departure of the Romans and the general
demolition of the buildings, by some houseless wanderers,
who, having ‘camped’ in the ruin, were
incommoded by the lodgement of rain on the floor.</p>

<p class='c000'>The hydraulic properties of the concrete used in
the floors of Roman hypocausts, has, I believe, escaped
the notice of previous writers, and is the only
other point which need longer detain us in this interesting
building. My attention was drawn to this
subject by my brother, Mr. George Barclay Bruce,
Member of the Institution of Civil Engineers, in
the following communication:—</p>

<p class='c014'>In many places on the line of the Wall, the mortar has had
mixed with it broken tiles or burned clay, to assist it in resisting
the moisture of the atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c014'>The concrete at Chesters placed between the slabs of the
bath-room, has a very large proportion of this burned clay,
and would thus be better suited to resist the action of heat
below and water above than purer lime.</p>

<p class='c014'>A portion of this concrete was taken, by way of experiment,
and burned in a crucible, as though it had been a piece of limestone;
it was then ground fine, and mixed with a proper
quantity of water; after being allowed to dry for three or
four hours, it was immersed in water, where it set in the same
manner as common mortar does in the open air, clearly proving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>its hydraulic properties. The same experiment was tried
with the ordinary mortar of the Wall, but without the same
result, there not being a sufficiently large quantity of burned
clay to enable it to stand so severe a test. In the case of the
concrete, it did not set so readily as what is called Roman
cement, but sufficiently so to prove that it is a strong hydraulic
mortar, made by the mixture of burned clay with common
lime.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE CEMETERY.</div>

<p class='c000'>Bidding farewell to these interesting structures, we
may now bend our steps a short way down the river,
on a visit to the cypress-grove—the burial ground of
the station. This, which in Horsley’s days formed
a separate field called the Ox-close, is now included
in the park of the domain. Never was spot more
appropriately chosen. The river here descends with
more than usual rapidity over its stony bed, and
bending at the same time to the left, exhibits to the
eye the lengthened vista of its well-wooded banks.
No earthly music could better soothe the chafed affections
of the hopeless heathen mourner than the
murmur of the stream which is ceaselessly heard in
this secluded nook. From this spot have been procured
several sepulchral slabs which will presently
afford us instruction; meantime, one is given on the
next page whose lesson is of a negative character. The
blank memorial shews how vain are the efforts which
even affection makes to render buoyant on the wave of
time the memory of those departed. Our very monuments
need memorials. But, passing this, the character
of the carving betokens a poor state of the arts,
and fixes its date in the lowest times of the empire: in
this we have a proof of the long-continued occupation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>of the station. The fate of the stone has been
singular. When Horsley saw it, the inscription was
legible; but having since been used as the door-stone
of the cow-house at Walwick Grange, the
letters had, previous to its removal to Alnwick-castle
(its present resting place), been entirely obliterated.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>ITS NAME ASCERTAINED.</div>

<p class='c000'>The station of <span class='sc'>Cilurnum</span>, which is the sixth on
the line of the Wall, was garrisoned by the second
wing of the Astures, (a regiment of Spanish cavalry)
commanded by a prefect. This fact has gradually
developed itself to the antiquary. Camden thought
it probable. Horsley concurred in the opinion,
and, in the absence of better evidence, sagaciously
referred to the tombstone of which a drawing is
here presented,
in proof of its having
been occupied
by a horse regiment.
‘That some
horse,’ says he,
'kept garrison
here in the lower
empire, seems to
be probable from
the inscription
and sculpture yet
remaining at Walwick-grange.'<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c012'><sup>[90]</sup></a>
‘The letters D.
M.,’ he remarks
in another place,
‘prove this to be a sepulchral monument, and the
figure shews that the deceased belonged to the
horse, and therefore probably was one of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Ala secunda
Astorum</em></span>, which in the lower empire kept garrison
at <span class='sc'>Cilurnum</span>, as the Notitia informs us.’</p>

more satisfactory
document
of stone was
discovered at
Chesters several
years ago,

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>Hutton, who has done such good service to the
Wall, under-rated the value of inscriptions. ‘When
the antiquary,’ says he, 'has laboured through a parcel
of miserable letters, what is he the wiser?'—Let
this fractured and defaced stone answer the question.<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c012'><sup>[93]</sup></a>
1. This dedication was made by soldiers of the second
wing of the Astures;—we thus learn the name of the
people who garrisoned the fort, and by a reference
to the Notitia, ascertain with certainty that this was<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>CILURNUM.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span class='sc'>Cilurnum</span>. 2. We acquire the fact, that a temple,
which through age had become dilapidated, was restored;—learning
thereby, not only the attention
which the Romans paid to what they conceived to
be religious duties, but their long occupation of this
spot. It has been already observed, that some of
the pillars of the hypocaust have been portions of a
prior building;—the ruin and inscription thus corroborate
each other. 3. The date of the dedication is
given; the third of the calends of November falls
upon the thirtieth of October, and the year in which
Gratus and Seleucus were consuls corresponds to
A.D. 221;—the data on which antiquaries found
their conclusions, are not always so vague as some
imagine. 4. Even the erasures are instructive. By
a reference to the date, we find that Heliogabalus
was reigning at the time of the dedication of the temple;
we find that what remain of the names and
titles on the stone apply to him; he, consequently,
is the emperor referred to. The year following he
was slain by his own soldiers, his body dragged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>through the streets and cast into the Tiber. The
soldiers in Britain seem to have sympathized
with their companions at Rome and to have erased
the name of the fallen emperor from the dedicatory
slab. Human nature is the same in every age. How
often have we, in modern times, seen a name cast
out with loathing which yesterday received the incense
of a world’s flattery!</p>

<p class='c000'>The above inscription gives us the station of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Ala
secunda Asturum</em></span>, in the reign of Heliogabalus, A.D.
221. The Notitia Imperii gives us its station in the
reign of Theodosius the younger, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘<em>ultra tempus Arcadii
et Honorii</em></span>,’ A.D. 430, and we find at both periods
the same force in the same station, which corresponds
with the understood practice of the Roman army with
regard to the permanency of the quarters of its auxiliary
forces. With reference to the difference between
the spelling of the inscription and the Notitia, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Asturum’</span>
and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Astorum,’</span> it may be observed that as
the Notitia Imperii was preserved for a thousand
years in manuscript before the art of printing came
to its rescue, it is more likely that the error should
be in the book, than on the stone.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ancient name of the station having been ascertained,
the etymology of it may be inquired into.
Whitaker says it means a creek. An authority acquainted
with the Gaelic language suggests the
following derivation; <i>caol</i>, narrow, probably pronounced
by the Romans <i>kil</i>, and <i>doir</i>, water (in
composition <i>dhoir</i>, the dh not sounded); so that
<i>caol-oir</i> is narrow stream; the <i>um</i> is a usual Latin
affix. Of course, this branch of the Tyne is narrow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>in comparison with the united floods. The word
may have had an Italian origin; the Latin <i>celer</i>, swift,
has some resemblance to it, and the river, when
swollen by floods, very speedily discharges its superfluous
water. Whatever be the origin of the
word, the names of the neighbouring places, Chollerton
and Chollerford, have had a similar derivation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The miscellaneous antiquities which have been

are of a very interesting character. Chief among
them is a broken statue, which is here represented.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fragment, consisting of
a fine-grained sandstone,
is six feet two inches
long. Statues of so large
a size are of very rare occurrence
in Roman camps

supposed to have been
meant for Cybele, the mother
of the gods. The
gracefulness of the design,
and the excellence of the
execution, show us that
the state of the arts in
Roman Britain was not so
low as is sometimes supposed.
The arrangement
of the drapery, and the
ornament placed upon its
margins, are suggestive of
the mode in which these details were managed in

the foot-marks of a dog, seemingly of the terrier
species. The animal must have run over it while
the clay was in a soft state. Plate <a href='#p190b'>VIII</a>. fig. 4.</p>

<p class='c000'>In making the excavations at the hypocausts,
many coins of silver and brass were found. They
extend from the reign of Hadrian to that of
Gratian; those of Constantine and his immediate
successors prevail. A massive silver signet ring, representing,
on a cornelian stone, a cock pecking at an
an ear of corn, was found in one of the rooms. As
is uniformly the case, numerous fragments of the
different kinds of pottery used by the Romans were
turned up; some of the fragments of vessels of Samian
ware are figured on Plate <a href='#p190d'>IX</a>. A key, fig. 4. an

from this treasury of Roman effects was the
tooth of a bear; it is of a large size, and is pierced

by a string, and wear it as a trophy or a charm on
his person. It is figured of the full size in <a href='#p190b'>Plate VII</a>.
Bears, as well as wolves, prowled in the forests of

struggle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not the least interesting of the circumstances of a
place of very early occupation, are the traditions
of the ‘ancients’ respecting it. Notwithstanding
their rudeness, some latent truth may generally
be educed from them; and they always manifest
the modes of thought that prevailed in former times.
Sixty years ago the traditions of the Wall might easily
have been gathered, but now the old men have nearly
forgotten the tales with which their ‘fore-elders’ used
to entertain them on a winter’s evening. The products
of the press have nearly superseded this unlettered
lore. A few fragments relative to <span class='sc'>Cilurnum</span>
have, however, been supplied to me. A belief used
to prevail, that there existed a subterranean stable
under the camp capable of containing five hundred
horse. It was, moreover, currently related, that
beneath the river a tunnel was formed, which led to
the opposite side. There is a pool in the vicinity of
the station, on its western side, called the Ingle-pool,
and which, until partially filled up a few
years ago, was very deep; the peasantry believed,
that it derived its supplies by an underground canal
from the North Tyne, at Nunwick-mill, between
three and four miles up the river.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>In these traditions we may perhaps recognise
the facts, that a regiment of horse garrisoned the
station; that the Romans carefully maintained the
means of intercourse with both sides of the river;
and that, if in this instance they did not, which is by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>no means certain, in others they undoubtedly did
bring water from great distances, either for the
purpose of sustenance, or to strengthen their position.</p>

<p class='c000'>We must now take leave of <span class='sc'>Cilurnum</span>. Whatever
may be the views of the reader, the visitor will
do so with regret. As Hodgson well remarks, ‘The
Astures, in exchanging the sunny valleys of Spain
for the banks of the tawny Tyne, might find the climate
in their new situation worse, but a lovelier spot
than <span class='sc'>Cilurnum</span> all the Asturias could not give them.’
During many days spent in the prosecution of my
inquiries here—the beauty of the landscape, the
instructive nature of the ruins, and the pleasant
intercourse which I was privileged to enjoy with the
hospitable family at the hall, combined to make a
deep impression upon my mind.</p>

<div class='sidenote c015'>CHESTERS.</div>

<p class='c000'>Again we bend our steps westward. Behind the
garden wall at Chesters stands a fragment of the
Wall. The north fosse is filled with water. Ascending
the hill which leads to Walwick, the earth
works are seen on the left hand. When near the
top of it, our out-door antiquary, while he pauses
for breath, will do well to look back, and contemplate
the scene he is leaving. The lines of the Barrier
are seen boldly descending the well-wooded and fertile
banks on the east side of the river. Warden-hill
is to the south, and will attract attention by its
elevation. Its summit is seen still to bear marks
of having been occupied by the aborigines of Britain.
Whilst the works of the Barrier were going on, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>may have maintained their position for a while, and,
from behind their entrenchments, scowled upon the
intruders who were soon to drive them to the remoter
region of the Cheviots. After watering both sides<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>WARDEN-FELL.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
of the tongue of land of which Warden-fell consists,
the North and South Tyne meet, and their waters
roll on in a united stream to the Emporium of the
North. We can follow it with the eye for some distance,
as it goes sparkling in the sunshine, spreading
fertility and beauty on either hand.</p>

      <div class='line'>Founded by Norman or by Saxon hands.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Nestled in the fairest part of the valley is the
abbey church of Hexham; closely inspected, it is
found to be a chaste specimen of the most simple
and beautiful of our ecclesiastical styles—the early
English, and, when viewed from a distance, as in
this case, its venerable towers lend a quiet charm
to the landscape.</p>

<p class='c000'>How different the scene which the Romans beheld!
In their day, and for long afterwards, the
painful cultivator of the soil knew not who should
reap the harvest; those only, therefore, who had
power to protect themselves would engage in the
occupation. Now, the husbandman dreams not of
a foreign foe, or of troops of lawless marauders;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>steadily he evokes the riches of the soil, and something
like an Eden smiles!</p>

<p class='c000'>A strip of the Wall, though in a disordered state,
and covered with brushwood, is in a field beyond
Walwick; its fosse is finely developed.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>TOWER-TAY.</div>

<p class='c000'>Ascending the next hill, called Tower Tay, the
earth-works are still very conspicuous. About half
way up are the ruins of a tower, erected about a
century ago, as an object in the landscape. It stands
on the Wall, and has been entirely formed out of its
stones. At the summit, the ditches of both Wall
and Vallum are cut through the native rock, of
which the hill consists, and are in excellent order.
The Wall stands very near the edge of a scar, sufficiently
elevated to have formed of itself a defence;
it is remarkable that the Romans should have thought
it necessary to draw a ditch on the north side of it
at all.</p>

<p class='c000'>Looking forward from the top of this hill, we see,
for a considerable distance, all the lines of the Barrier
proceeding on their course; descending one hill
and ascending the opposite, called the Limestone-bank,
they keep perfectly parallel. It would have
delighted Horsley’s heart to notice that the present
road runs upon the north agger of the Vallum,
maintaining, as he did, that this was the Military
Way of Agricola.</p>

<p class='c000'>At a short distance, further in advance, the ruins
of a mile-castle are seen on the right. The whole of
the facing-stones are gone, as is usually the case, and
the place where it stood is chiefly marked by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>vacuity occasioned by their removal. This castellum
measures, inside, fifty-four feet from east to
west, and sixty-one from north to south; it has been
protected by a fosse. A long range of the Wall is
next seen in the Black-carts farm, in an encouraging
state of preservation; it is between five and six feet
high, and shews, in some places, seven courses of
facing-stones.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>TEPPER-MOOR.</div>

<p class='c000'>On the summit of the next hill, many objects of
great interest await us. The view from it is most
extensive. To the north, a vast sweep of country
meets the eye; a beautiful undulated valley occupies
the foreground, behind it the hills rise boldly,
and the lofty Cheviots bound the scene. Chipchase
castle occupies a commanding position. The modern
mansion of Nunwick, embowered in wood, selects
the lower ground. Towards the west, the lofty crags
traversed by the Wall come into view.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the corner of a field adjoining the road, are the
remains of another mile-castle; it measures fifty-seven
feet by fifty-four. Horsley says, it was detached
about a yard from the Wall, the reason of
which was not very obvious. A portion of the
Roman Military Way may here be seen as it curves
towards the gateway of the castellum, and again
recedes from it. A good section of it is obtained
at the margin of the places where its stones have
been removed to form the stone dikes of the field.</p>

<p><span class='small'>H. Burdon Richardson, Del.<span style="margin-left: 50%;">John Storey, Lith.</span></span><br />THE WORKS, TEPPER MOOR.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The fosse of the Wall and Vallum at this point
deserve attentive examination. In passing over the
crown of the hill, they have been excavated with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>enormous labour out of the basalt of which the summit
consists. The workmen, as if exhausted with
the task of raising the splintered fragments, have
left them lying on the sides of the moats. A mass
on the outside of the north ditch, though now split
by the action of the frost into three pieces, has evidently
formed one block, and cannot weigh less than
thirteen tons. It is not easy to conceive how they
managed to quarry so tough a rock without the aid
of gunpowder, or contrived to lift, with the machinery
at their command, such huge blocks. No
luis-holes appear in them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The lithograph presents a view of the giant works
of the Vallum and fosse at this point. It is quite
evident that here, at least, the north agger did not
form the Military Way. There are several breaks
and irregularities in both the mounds; the works
have probably been left by the Romans in a rough,
unfinished state.</p>

<p class='c000'>Between this spot and the craggy summit on
which Sewingshields farm-house is perched, the
ground is flat, and destitute of any decided descent
to the north. On this account, and for mutual defence,
the lines of the Barrier keep close together,
so close, sometimes, as scarcely to leave room for
the passage of the Military Way between them.</p>

<div class='sidenote c015'>PROCOLITIA.</div>

<p class='c000'>PROCOLITIA is the seventh stationary camp
on the line of the Wall. It was garrisoned by the
first Batavian cohort, which, with two others from
the same country, and the two Tungrian cohorts,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>was with Agricola in his great battle with Galgacus
in the Grampian Hills. That the ruined camp at
Carrawburgh was the adopted home of this cohort,
is proved by the altar engraved on page <a href='#Page_62'>62</a>, and by
<span id='p198' class='figright id027'><img src='images/i_p198.jpg' alt='Slab—Coh. I. Batavorum' class='ig001' /></span>the fractured slab now introduced,<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c012'><sup>[94]</sup></a> and which was
found here in the year 1838. On this
mutilated stone, the words <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='fss'>COH I BATAVORVM</span></span>
are quite distinct, and are of
themselves sufficient, not only to fix
the site of the ancient <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='sc'>Procolitia</span></span>,
but to corroborate the testimony of
Tacitus, on the presence of
Batavians in Britain during
the period of Roman occupation.
The line following may
probably be read <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='fss'>INST[ANT]E
BVRRIO</span></span>, and bears the name of
the prefect under whose superintendence
the building was erected, to which the
slab referred. In the last line, the word <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='fss'>CO[RNELIANO</span></span>
may be perceived. In 237, when Maximinus was
emperor, Titius Perpetuus and Rusticus Cornelianus
were consuls. That this is the date of the inscription
is rendered likely from a fragment of this emperor’s
name appearing in the beginning of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whitaker gives, as the meaning of the word
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='sc'>Procolitia</span></span>, the ‘fortress in the woodlands.’ In the
Gaelic tongue, <i>coille</i> signifies a wood.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>There is little in this station to detain us. The
course of its ramparts and moats can be easily traced,
and the rich green sward of its area is seen to cover
numerous irregular heaps of ruins; every building,
however, is prostrate; scarcely one stone is left upon
another. The Wall forms the northern boundary
of the station; its eastern and western gateways are,
as usual, opposite to each other, but strike the side
walls between the upper end and the middle. The
position of the southern gateway cannot be detected;
in the present state of the ruins, there is no appearance
of one. The southern corners are rounded off,
but the side walls of the station, in joining the Murus
on the north, seem to preserve their rectilinear
course. Outside the western wall are the ruins of
the suburbs. A natural valley, consisting at present
of boggy ground, gives strength to the fortification
on this side. Horsley saw a well in the slack,
cased with Roman masonry; it is now removed.</p>

<p class='c000'>No modern habitation is on the ground or in its
immediate vicinity to relieve the general desolation—</p>

<div class='sidenote'>CARRAWBURGH.</div>

<p class='c000'>Passing onwards, we soon reach the farm-house
of Carraw, formerly a rural retreat of the priors of
Hexham. On the crown of the next elevation, the
works are brought into close proximity, apparently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>for the purpose of avoiding an extensive bog on the
north, and of maintaining possession of the point of
the hill on the south. The earth-works are very
boldly developed, but are in a ragged state. The
contents of the north fosse are piled up high on its
outer margin. The fosse of the Vallum is cut through
free-stone rock; its southern agger is very elevated,
and would present a bold and angry front to any intruder
from the south.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE GREAT MURAL RIDGE.</div>

<p class='c000'>We must now, to adopt the language of Hutton,
‘quit the beautiful scenes of cultivation, and enter
upon the rude of nature, and the wreck of antiquity.’
Four great mountain waves are before us, and seem
to chase each other to the north, on which side their
crests rise almost perpendicularly. To the highest
of these, the second from the south, the Wall directs
its course. It is a ridge of basalt, which crosses the
island obliquely, from Cumberland to Holy Island.
The Vallum here parts company with the Wall, and
takes the ‘tail’ of the hill on the ‘crag’ of which
the other runs. The accompanying drawing shews
the nature of the country before us.</p>

</div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Before approaching Sewingshields<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c012'><sup>[95]</sup></a> farm-house,
which is on the line of Wall, an experienced eye
will detect the Roman Military Way. It runs at
first nearly parallel with the Wall, at about thirty-six
paces from it, but, in its subsequent course, recedes
from the Barrier, or approaches it, according
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>to the position of the mile-castles, and the nature of
the ground. With but few interruptions, it may be
traced by the appearance of its herbage, by its
slightly elevated, rounded form, and by the occasional
protrusion of the stones composing it, all the
way from Sewingshields to Thirlwall.</p>

<p class='c000'>The north fosse, which we have had in view from
the very commencement of our journey, accompanies
the Wall for a short distance up the hill, as
is seen in the lithograph, but when the ground becomes
precipitous, it forsakes it until the high grounds
are passed, only to appear when the Wall sinks into
a gap or chasm between the crags.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE WALL ON THE CRAGS.</div>

<p class='c000'>A difficulty will here present itself to nearly every
mind; why was the Wall drawn along the cliffs at
all? Horsley cut the knot instead of untying it. ‘As
such steep rocks,’ says he, ‘are a sufficient fence of
themselves, I am inclined to think the Wall has not
in those parts had either strength or thickness, equal
to what it has had in other parts.’ Present appearances
give us no reason to suppose that the Wall on
the crags was in any respect inferior to what it was
in the low grounds. A different method of accounting
for the circumstance has been forced upon my
attention. It was my fortune to traverse the heights
near Sewingshields late in December last year, when
the wind blew a violent gale from the north, and
the thermometer, even in the valley, was ten degrees
below the freezing point. In order to maintain the
ordinary temperature of the body, very active exertion
was necessary, and to make any progress on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>my way, I was constrained to get under the lee of
the hill. The conclusion was irresistible; if the
Romans were to keep watch and ward here during
the winter, a Wall was necessary, even though only for
the sake of sheltering them from the blast. The
habits of the enemy demanded continual vigilance;
for, as Tacitus tells us, before the time of Agricola
they usually repaired the losses they had sustained
in summer by the success of their winter expeditions.
The loftier the mountain peak, the more
necessary, in this view of it, was the friendly shelter of
the Wall to the shivering soldiers of southern Europe.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>SEWINGSHIELDS.</div>

<p class='c000'>The Wall in the neighbourhood of Sewingshields
is not in good condition; its site is marked by the
rubble which encumbers it, but the facing-stones
are gone, having contributed to the erection of every
building in the vicinity, from the time of Honorius
to the present day. A considerable tract of it was
removed lately. Thorough draining, the life of
agriculture, is death to the Wall.</p>

<p class='c000'>The aspect of the country in the immediate vicinity
of the heights of Sewingshields is dreary enough,
but the elevation enables the eye to revel in the fertility
and beauty of the distant landscape. Hexham
is distinctly discernible from the farm-house. On
the flats to the north of the crags, there formerly
stood the border fortress, Sewingshields castle.<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c012'><sup>[96]</sup></a> It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>was at one time the property of the late Ralph Spearman,
esq., the Monkbarns of <span class='sc'>The Antiquary</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>MURAL TRADITIONS.</div>

<p class='c000'>A situation so remote from the crowded haunts of
men is favourable to the preservation of legendary
lore. It occurred to me that here, if anywhere, I
might ascertain the kind of ideas which the rude
forefathers of the mural region entertained respecting
the Wall and its builders. Although on the Antonine
Wall all tradition of the Romans has been lost,
this has certainly not been the case here; the recollection
of them is still distinctly preserved, and some
stories of them are told, which, though in several respects
resembling written history, are not derived from
this source. For the following scraps of traditional information,
I am chiefly indebted to the master of
Grindon school, in the immediate neighbourhood of
Sewingshields, who says he has often heard them
repeated. Though he denominates them ‘absurd,’
the learned in mediæval legends will probably think
them worth preserving.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Romans are said to have been remarkably lazy, so
much so, that in the hot weather of summer, having almost
nothing to do, they lay basking in the sun, on the south side
of the Wall, almost in a state of torpor. The Scots were
in the habit of watching their opportunity, and, throwing
hooks, with lines attached to them, over the Wall, caught
the poor Romans by their clothes or flesh, and by this means,
dragging them to the other side, made them prisoners.</p>

<p class='c014'>An old man in this neighbourhood told me, that he had often
heard people say, that the Romans had remarkably broad feet,
with still broader shoes, and that, when it rained, they lay on
their backs, and holding up their feet in a perpendicular
direction, protected, by this means, their persons from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>weather.—This legend, under various modifications, seems to
have been widely diffused in the middle ages. Sir John
Maundevile, describing ‘Ethiope,’ says—‘In that contree,
ben folk that han but o foot; and thei gon so fast, that it is
marvaylle; and the foot is so large, that it schadewethe all
the body azen the sonne, whan they wole lye and reste hem.’
Precisely similar to this is Pliny’s account—'<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Item hominum
genus, qui Monoscelli vocarentur, singulis cruribus, miræ pernicitatis
ad saltum: eosdemque Sciopodas vocari, quod in
majori æstu, humi jacentes resupini, umbra se pedum protegant.</span>'<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c012'><sup>[97]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>It is the tradition of the country that all the stones of the
Wall were handed from one man to another by a set of labourers
stationed in a line from the quarry to the place where
they were required. Many will tell you, 'I have heard my mother
say, that the Wall was built in a single night, and that
no one was observed to be engaged upon it, save an old woman
with an apron full of stones.'—This, however, is a tradition
of almost universal application.</p>

<p class='c014'>The people say that the Wall was hollow, or, as they express
it, had a flue running the whole length of it, through which the
sentinels communicated intelligence by a speaking trumpet.</p>

<p class='c014'>Some of the people of this neighbourhood tell me that the
Britons, tired, at length, of Roman oppression, rose in a body,
and drove the garrison, with considerable slaughter, from all
their stations. The Romans, when making their way to the
sea to look for ships to carry them home, were met by a seer,
who told them that if they returned home they would all be
drowned; and if they went back to their old stations they
would all be slain. This prophecy disconcerted them greatly,
and they were at their wits’ end; however, after long consultation,
they resolved to escape both calamities by marching
direct to Wales. This they did, and there the pure, unadulterated
Roman breed is to be found to this day.—Can this
story refer to the passage of the second legion, at an early
period, to Caerleon?</p>

<div class='sidenote'>LEGENDS OF KING ARTHUR.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>We next pass on to some tales, which, though
not connected with the Wall, belong, as Hodgson
remarks, to times nearer the Roman than these degenerate
days. They chiefly relate to king Arthur.
Sir William Betham observes that this monarch’s
name is more celebrated in Scotland than in Wales,
which was the chief resort of the conquered Britons,
and is disposed to think, that this favourite hero of
romance was not a Romanized Briton, but an invading
Pictish king. This idea would account for the frequent
reference to his name in the region of the Wall.</p>

<p class='c014'>Immemorial tradition has asserted, that king Arthur, his
queen Guenever, his court of lords and ladies, and his hounds,
were enchanted in some cave of the crags, or in a hall below
the castle of Sewingshields, and were to continue entranced
there till some one should first blow a bugle horn that lay on
a table near the entrance of the hall, and then with ‘the
sword of the stone’ cut a garter also placed there beside it.
But none had ever heard where the entrance to this enchanted
hall was, till the farmer at Sewingshields, about fifty years
since, was sitting upon the ruins of the castle, and his clew
fell, and ran downwards through a rush of briars and nettles,
as he supposed, into a deep subterranean passage. Firm in
the faith that the entrance into king Arthur’s hall was now
discovered, he cleared the briary portal of its weeds and rubbish,
and entering a vaulted passage, followed, in his darkling
way, the thread of his clew. The floor was infested with
toads and lizards; and the dark wings of bats, disturbed by
his unhallowed intrusion, flitted fearfully around him. At
length, his sinking courage was strengthened by a dim, distant
light, which, as he advanced, grew gradually brighter, till, all
at once, he entered a vast and vaulted hall, in the centre of
which, a fire without fuel, from a broad crevice in the floor,
blazed with a high and lambent flame, that shewed all the
carved walls and fretted roof, and the monarch and his queen,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>reposing around in a theatre of thrones and costly couches.
On the floor, beyond the fire, lay the faithful and deep-toned
pack of thirty couple of hounds; and on a table before it, the
spell-dissolving horn, sword, and garter. The shepherd reverently,
but firmly, grasped the sword, and as he drew it
leisurely from its rusty scabbard, the eyes of the monarch,
and of his courtiers began to open, and they rose till they sat
upright. He cut the garter; and as the sword was being
slowly sheathed, the spell assumed its ancient power, and they
all gradually sunk to rest; but not before the monarch had
lifted up his eyes and hands, and exclaimed:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c005'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>O woe betide that evil day</div>
      <div class='line'>On which this witless wight was born,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who drew the sword—the garter cut,</div>
      <div class='line'>But never blew the bugle-horn.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Terror brought on loss of memory, and the shepherd was unable
to give any correct account of his adventure, or to find
again the entrance to the enchanted hall.<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c012'><sup>[98]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>To the north of Sewingshields, two strata of sandstone
crop out to the day; the highest points of each ledge are
called the King and Queen’s-crag, from the following legend.
King Arthur, seated on the farthest rock, was talking with
his queen, who, meanwhile, was engaged in arranging her
‘back hair.’ Some expression of the queen’s having offended
his majesty, he seized a rock which lay near him, and, with
an exertion of strength for which the Picts were proverbial,
threw it at her, a distance of about a quarter of a mile! The
queen, with great dexterity, caught it upon her comb, and thus
warded off the blow; the stone fell between them, where it
lies to this day, with the marks of the comb upon it, to attest
the truth of the story. It probably weighs about twenty tons!</p>

<p class='c014'>A few miles to the north of Sewingshields stands an upright
stone, which bears the name of Cumming’s cross. Cumming, a
northern chieftain, having paid, one day, a visit to king Arthur
at his castle near Sewingshields, was kindly received by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>king, and was, as a token of lasting friendship, presented by
him with a gold cup. The king’s sons coming in, shortly
after Cumming had left the castle, and being informed of
what their father had done, immediately set out in pursuit of
him. They overtook him, and slew him at this place, which
has borne the name of Cumming’s cross ever since.</p>

<p class='c014'>King Arthur’s chair used to be pointed out in this vicinity.
It was a column of basalt, fifty feet high, slightly detached
from the rest of the cliff. The top of it had something of the
appearance of a seat. It was thrown down, several years
ago, by a party of idle young men, who were at great pains
to effect their foolish purpose.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>SEWINGSHIELDS CRAGS.</div>

<p class='c000'>We now return to our more immediate object,
the examination of the Wall.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soon after leaving Sewingshields, a narrow chasm
in the rocks, slightly aided by art, called the Catgate,
admits of an awkward descent to the plain
below. Here, says Hutton, the Scots bored under
the Wall, so as to admit the body of a man.
Whether the Romans or the Scots made this passage,
it is certain that the garrison on the Wall
would sometimes visit the country to the north, for
the purposes of plunder and of slaughter, and would
require the means of egress.</p>

<p class='c000'>The mile-castles may now all be recognised in
due succession.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>BUSY GAP.</div>

<p class='c000'>The next point of interest is Busy-gap, a broad,
basin-like recess in the mountain ridge, about a
mile from Sewingshields. The Wall here, being
more than usually exposed, is not only strengthened
with the fosse common in the low grounds, but has
the additional protection of a rampart, of triangular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>form, to the north of this. The wood-cut will give
some idea of the arrangement. A common stone
dike occupies at present the place of the Wall, the
foundations of which, and, for the most part, a portion
of the grout of the interior, remain. At a little
elevation, on the western side of the valley, is a gate
called the King’s-wicket (Arthur’s again, probably),
through which a drove-road passes. The gate is
well situated for defence, and may have been a
Roman passage.</p>

<div id='p208'  class='figcenter id018'>
<img src='images/i_p208.jpg' alt='Busy Gap' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Busy-gap was in the middle ages a place of much
notoriety; it was the pass frequented by the moss-troopers
and reavers of the debateable country.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>STATE OF THE BORDERS.</div>

<p class='c000'>The incessant war which was waged between
England and Scotland before the union of the two
kingdoms, rendered property exceedingly insecure,
and nurtured a race of men who had no expectation
of holding their own, unless they could repel force
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>by force. It was the policy of the governments of
both countries, to maintain on the Borders a body of
men inured to feats of arms, whom, on any emergency,
they might call to their assistance. Habits
long indulged are not easily laid aside. When the
policy of Elizabeth, and the accession of James
to the throne of England, allayed the national strife,
the stern warriors of the Border degenerated into
sheep-stealers; and, instead of dying in the fray, or
yielding their necks <em>honourably</em> to the headsman’s
stroke, burdened by the score the gallows-tree at
Newcastle or Carlisle. The vales of North Tyne
and the Rede, which anciently abounded with warriors,
became infested with thieves. It is impossible to
imagine the desolation and misery occasioned by
such a state of society. Landed property was of
little value. Precious life was idly sacrificed. Bernard
Gilpin, the ‘apostle of the north,’ was esteemed
a brave man because he annually ventured as far as
Rothbury to preach the gospel of peace to the lawless
people of the vale of Coquet. Camden and
sir Robert Cotton, though ardently desirous of examining
the Wall, durst not venture in their progress
eastward beyond Carvoran. ‘From thence,’
Camden says, ‘the Wall goeth forward more aslope
by Iverton, Forsten, and Chester-in-the-Wall, near
to Busy-gap, a place infamous for thieving and robbing,
where stood some castles (chesters they called
them), as I have heard, but I could not with safety
take the full survey of it, for the rank robbers thereabouts.’
In such ill-repute were the people of these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>parts, even in their own county, that we find the
Newcastle Merchants’ company in 1564, enacting
that ‘no free brother shall take non apprentice to
serve in the fellyshipe of non such as is or shall be
borne or brought up in Tyndale, Lyddisdale, or any
such lycke places, on pain of 20<em>ll</em>,’ because, says the
order, ‘the parties there brought up are known,
either by education or nature, not to be of honest
conversation; they commit frequent thefts and other
felonys, proceeding from such lewde and wicked
progenitors.’ The offence of calling a fellow-free-man
‘a Bussey-gap rogue,’ was sufficiently serious
to attract the attention of a guild; a case of this
kind being recorded in the books of the Bakers and
Brewers’ company of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, 1645.</p>

<p class='c000'>The traces of this disordered state of society remained
until the early part of the reign of George III.,
when the sheriff of Northumberland was first enabled
to execute process in the north-western parts of the
county. ‘Within my own recollection,’ says Mr.
Hedley, ‘almost every old house in the dales of Rede
and Tyne was what is called a <em>Peel</em> house, built for
securing its inhabitants and their cattle in the moss-trooping
times.’ Very many of these yet exist. Far
different is the state of the district now. The men of
the mural region, and of the vales of North Tyne,
and Rede-water, are as upright as any in England.
With the exception of a few aged individuals, an
uneducated person is not to be found. Although,
in addition to the ordinary courts of law, they have
access to courts-leet and courts-baron, (those admirable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>institutions by which our Saxon forefathers gave
to the poorest villager the ready means of procuring
redress of wrong,) nowhere has the law less occasion
forcibly to assert its claims. Property is secure,
and land brings its full price in the market. On
some of the extensive farms of the Cheviot range,
not fewer than ten thousand sheep are kept; they are
counted but twice a year, and seldom is one amissing.
The value of land in Northumberland (exclusive
of towns and mines) is seven times greater
than it was at the commencement of the eighteenth
century, and two hundred times what it was in the
middle of the sixteenth. The antiquary, who will
not fail to rejoice in the prosperity of the country
through which he is travelling, as well as in the
safety of his own person, may therefore go on his
way cheerfully and in confidence.</p>

<p class='c000'>The second mile-castle from Sewingshields, opposite
the farm-house called the Kennel, is remarkable
as having been built upon an absolute declivity.
Hodgson observes that it had an interior wall on
every side of it, at the distance of about twenty feet
from the exterior wall.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE BLACK DIKE.</div>

<p class='c000'>Shortly after leaving Busy-gap, two narrow, but
rather steep gaps are passed in quick succession,
which do not seem to have obtained names. Through
the first of these the <span class='sc'>Black Dike</span> has probably run.
This is an earth-work of unknown antiquity, which is
supposed to have stretched, in a nearly straight line,
from the borders of Scotland near Peel-fell, through
Northumberland and Durham, to the south of Yorkshire.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>The scantiness of the soil on the crags of
the Wall, accounts for its not being discernible there,
and the ground immediately to the north and south
of it is boggy. In a plantation on the hill side, opposite
to where we now are, looking south, the dike
exists in excellent preservation. The <i>seuch</i>, or slack
of it, may be seen even from the Wall, on the western
edge of the plantation, which is called the ‘Black-dike
planting.’ From the information of those who knew
it half a century ago, I shall set down its probable
course in this vicinity. Coming in a south-east direction,
it passes the east end of Broomlee-lough; having
cleared the Wall and Vallum, it goes by the west of
Beggar-bog, the east of Low Morwood, through the
Muckle-moss, and so to the Black-dike plantation.
Passing afterwards a field called the Black-hall, it is
last seen on the north bank of the Tyne near the
Water-house. It re-appears on the south bank at
Morley, and passing Tedcastle and Dean-row, is
supposed to go by Allenheads into the county of
Durham. In the best piece of it which I have seen,
the ditch is ten feet across the top, and about five feet
deep, reckoning from the top of the mound on its east
side. Within the memory of my informants, it was
much deeper. The sheep were often covered up in it
in a snow-storm, as they naturally went there for shelter.
The earth taken out of the ditch is uniformly thrown
to the east side, where it forms an embankment. No
stones, or such only as were derived from the cutting,
have been used in its formation. The only conjecture
hazarded respecting its origin is, that it formed the line
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>of demarcation between the kingdoms of Northumbria
and Cumbria; and certainly the course pursued by
the Black-dike is very nearly similar to the boundary
assigned to these regions in the most authentic
maps of Saxon England. The antiquity of the cutting
may be inferred from the circumstances, that for
some distance it forms the division between the
adjacent parishes of Haltwhistle and Warden, and
that it passes through bogs which probably owe their
origin to the devastations committed in the north of
England by William the Norman.<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c012'><sup>[99]</sup></a> The Black-dike
is laid down in the map of Northumberland which
was prepared to accompany Horsley’s Britannia, and
in Kitchin’s Map of Northumberland, under the
name of the  ‘Scots’-dike.’</p>

<p class='c000'>South of the turnpike road, and behind a small
house, called Beggar-bog, is a low freestone crag,
which exhibits some quarry-like excavations, filled
with the chippings of stone. It has probably furnished
material for the Wall, the stone being of
the same character.</p>

<p class='c000'>The stream which we next cross is the Knag-burn;
it forms the eastern boundary of Housesteads. Passing
it, we scale the ramparts of this far-famed station.</p>

<div class='sidenote c015'>THE ANCIENT BORCOVICUS.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>BORCOVICUS.—‘This’ says Gordon, ‘is unquestionably
the most remarkable and magnificent
station in the whole island;’ and ‘it is hardly credible
what a number of august remains of the Roman
grandeur is to be seen here to this day, seeing in
every place where one casts his eye there is some
curious Roman antiquity to be seen: either the
marks of streets and temples in ruins, or inscriptions,
broken pillars, statues, and other pieces of
sculpture all scattered along the ground.’ Stukely,
in the vehemence of his admiration, denominates it
‘the Tadmor of Britain.’ Let not the visitor, however,
approach it with expectations too greatly excited.
There is very much to admire, but not a
great deal to strike the eye at first sight. The altars
and sculptured figures which lay in profusion on the
ground when Gordon and Stukely were there, have
been removed,<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c012'><sup>[100]</sup></a> but the ruins of the place remain as
complete and vast as ever. The city is, in a great
measure, covered with its own debris, but the excavations
which have recently been made, shew us
that when they are continued throughout the entire
station, the ancient <span class='sc'>Borcovicus</span> will be the Pompeii
of Britain.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>HOUSESTEADS.</div>

<p class='c000'>The station of Housesteads contains an area of
nearly five acres. 'Half of it hangs on a slope, with
a southern aspect: the other, or northern half, is
flat, floored with basalt, covers the summit of a lofty
ridge, and commands a prospect on the east, south,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>and west, far away beyond the valley of the Tyne,
over blue air-tinted grounds and lofty mountains;
and to the north of the Wall, over the vast waste of
the forest of Lowes, where indeed, a proud, stupendous
solitude frowns o’er the heath.'</p>

<p class='c000'>The Wall forms its northern boundary, and the
Vallum, it is probable, came to the support of
its southern rampart.<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c012'><sup>[101]</sup></a> It is naturally defended on
all sides, except the west. In order duly to protect
this side, the gateway seems to have been walled
up at an early period, and a triple line of ramparts
drawn along it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although the position of Housesteads clearly indicates
that this fort was erected for the accommodation
of a mural garrison, it would seem to have been
built independently of the Wall. The first anxiety
of the soldiers engaged in that great work would be
to erect a secure habitation for themselves. The
west wall of the station, instead of coming up to
the great Wall in a straight line, makes the curve
which is usual in those corners of a camp that are
independent of the Wall; as is shewn in the wood-cut
at the top of the next page.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>BORCOVICUS.</div>

<p class='c000'>All the gateways, except the north, have been
explored, and present very interesting subjects of
study to the antiquary. The western<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>WEST GATEWAY OF BORCOVICUS.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
is in the best condition, and is specially
worthy of attention. Its arrangements
will readily be understood by an inspection
of the ground plan which is here introduced,
together with the views of it as
seen from the outside and inside of the
station, on the next page. This gateway,
as well as the others which have been
explored, is, in every sense of the word,
double. Two walls must be passed
before the camp can be entered; each
is provided with two portals, and each
portal has been closed with two-leaved
gates. The southern entrance of the
outside wall has alone, as yet, been entirely
cleared of the masonry that closed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>it. The jambs and pillars are formed of massive
stones of rustic masonry. The doors, if we may
judge from the fragments of corroded iron which
have been lately picked up, were of wood, strengthened
with iron plates and studs; they moved, as is
apparent from the pivot-holes, upon pivots of iron.
In the centre of each portal stands a strong upright
stone, against which the gates have shut. Some of
the large projecting stones of the exterior wall are
worn as if by the sharpening of knives upon them;
this has probably been done by the occupants of the
suburban buildings after the closing of the gateway.
The guard-chambers on each side are in a state of
choice preservation, one of the walls standing fourteen
courses high. Were a roof put on them,
the antiquary might here stand guard, as the Tungrians
did of old, and, for a while, forget that the
world is sixteen centuries older than it was when these
chambers were reared. At least two of the chambers
in this part of the camp have been warmed by
U shaped flues running round three of their sides
beneath the floor.<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c012'><sup>[102]</sup></a> These chambers, when recently
excavated, were found to be filled with rubbish so
highly charged with animal matter as painfully to
affect the sensibilities of the labourers. The teeth
and bones of oxen, horns resembling those of the
red-deer, but larger, and boars’ tusks were very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>abundant; there was the usual quantity of all the
kinds of pottery used by the Romans. It is not
improbable that this rubbish may have been derived
from some dunghill outside the walls, and thrown
here when the gateway was walled up; it is, however,
a remarkable fact, that the soil of the interior area
of the stations on the Wall is, for the most part,
thickly mingled with bones. Is it possible that the
Romans have thrown on the floors of their apartments,
and suffered to remain amongst the straw
or rushes which may have covered them, the refuse
of their food?</p>

<p class='c000'>The view of Housesteads in the accompanying
lithograph, is taken from beside the eastern gateway,
and gives a general idea of the scene of desolation
which it presents.<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c012'><sup>[103]</sup></a> The only habitation near
is a shepherd’s cottage to the south of the station.
A peculiarity in the upper division of the eastern
gateway requires attention; the lower division, as
seen in the lithograph, has been walled up at an early
period. A rut, nearly nine inches deep, appears in
the threshold, on each side of the central stone against
which the gates closed. Grooves, similar in character,
are seen in the gateways of the camps at Birdoswald
and Maryport. Were it not for the central
stone, which presents an impediment to the passage
of chariots, no one would doubt that these hollows
have been occasioned by the action of their wheels.
The following extract, explanatory of the condition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>of the city of Pompeii, will probably throw light upon
this and other things belonging to the camp.</p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>RUTS IN THE GATEWAY.</div>

<p class='c014'>The Domitian way which led to it was narrow, the carriage-way
seldom exceeding ten feet in width. The streets of the
city itself are paved with large irregular pieces of lava, joined
neatly together, in which the chariot wheels have worn ruts,
still discernible; in some places they are an inch and a half
deep, and in narrow streets follow one track.... In most
places, the streets are so narrow, that they may be crossed
at one stride; where they are wider, a raised stepping-stone
has been placed in the centre of the crossing. This, though
in the middle of the carriage-way, did not much inconvenience
those who drove about in the <i>biga</i>, or two-horsed chariot, because
the width of these streets being only sufficient to admit
the carriage, the wheels passed freely in the spaces left between
the curb on either side, and the stone in the centre.<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c012'><sup>[104]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The stone in the centre of the doorway would not
be a greater impediment than the stepping stones
in the streets of Pompeii.</p>

<p class='c000'>The remains of the gateways of <span class='sc'>Borcovicus</span> shew
that in plan and construction they must have resembled
the Roman Gateway which, under the name of the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Porta nera,’</span> is preserved entire at Treves, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='fss'>AUGUSTA
TREVIRORUM</span></span>, once the seat of government of the
Western Empire.</p>

<p class='c000'>In examining this and other Roman camps, the
spectator will, perhaps, be struck with the narrowness
of the streets, and the very small capacity of the
the dwellings. It is well to recollect that in their
encampments the Romans studiously avoided occupying
a larger space than was absolutely necessary.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>Gibbon observes that a modern army would present
to the enemy a front three times as extended as a
Roman one of the same force. In the field, ten men
were apportioned to a tent, ten feet square;<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c012'><sup>[105]</sup></a> a similar
proportion would without doubt be followed in
the stationary camp.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>BORCOVICUS.</div>

<p class='c000'>It is not easy to ascertain the precise character of
the dwellings of the soldiers; the more perfect of the
ruins in this and other forts, induce the belief that
they were dark, bare, and cheerless. The roofs were
probably formed of free-stone slate. Several thin
slabs of this kind, with nail-holes in them, as well as
some of the nails themselves, have been found in
this and other stations.<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c012'><sup>[106]</sup></a> On <a href='#p224f'>Plate XIII</a>, figs. 1, 7,
are drawn some door or window heads, found here;
these most likely belonged to buildings of a superior
class. The entrance into a chamber at <span class='sc'>Habitancum</span>,
recently excavated, was found to be only fourteen
inches wide; it was rudely ‘stepped over’ at the top.
Fragments of a sort of window glass are frequently
found in some of the stations; this would probably
be a rare luxury.<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c012'><sup>[107]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE CHAMBERS OF THE STATION.</div>

<p class='c000'>At Housesteads, two or three of the ruined chambers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>will, above the rest, attract the attention of the
visitor. Near the centre of the northern division is
one which is seventy feet long and eight broad; it
must have been a place of public concourse. In the
front of it is a kiln which has probably been used
for drying corn; near the southern gateway is
another which was nearly destroyed in the endeavour
made to extricate a cow which had fallen into
it, and, in struggling to relieve herself, had thrust
her head and neck into the flue. The Romans seem
to have kiln-dried their corn at the close of the harvest;
it would not have been safe to stack it in the
open fields. They would the more readily do this,
as it is still by no means unusual, in the central and
southern parts of Europe, to thrash the corn at the
close of harvest on the field where it grew.</p>

<p class='c000'>Three hypocausts have been found here, two
within the station, and another to the east of it, on
the Knag-burn; the flues of the latter were full of
soot; very slight traces of any of them now remain.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this and most other stations, writes Hodgson,
‘there are found considerable quantities of limestone,
having partly the character of stalagmite, and partly
that of such cellular stone as forms about the mouths
of petrifying wells. Some of it is in amorphous
lumps; but the greatest part of it has been either
sawn into rectangular pieces, or formed in a fluid
state in moulds.’ They are probably artificial; at
<span class='sc'>Habitancum</span>, where this calcareous substance is
abundant, it seems to have acquired its porosity by
being mixed with straw. The use to which it has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>been applied is by no means obvious. Hodgson
thought that it had been inserted in the side walls of
the hypocausts, to allow heat to arise from below
without smoke. This is doubtful. At <span class='sc'>Habitancum</span>,
the blocks, I am told, have been used as ordinary
stones. In the construction of the Pharos at Dover,
(where building stone is scarce) the calcareous composition
has been largely used. Why it should have
been employed at <span class='sc'>Habitancum</span>, and other places,
where free-stone is abundant, does not appear.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>BORCOVICUS</div>
<p class='c000'>The suburbs of <span class='sc'>Borcovicus</span> have been very extensive,
the ruins of them distinctly appearing on
the east, south, and west sides of the station. A
little to the south of it, and stretching westward, the
ground has been thrown up in long terraced lines,
a mode of cultivation much practised in Italy and
in the east. Similar terraces, more feebly developed,
appear at Bradley; I have seen them very distinctly
marked on the banks of the Rede-water, Old Carlisle
and other places.</p>

<p class='c000'>A well, cased with Roman masonry, is in front of
the shepherd’s house, south of the station; a spring,
yielding excellent water, is at the bottom of the same
field; the Knag-burn washes the station on its eastern
side, and there is ‘a fine well under the high
basaltic cliff’ on which the northern wall of the
station stands, ‘which is still well walled round,’
and has occasionally been used as a bath. None has
been discovered within the station itself.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>ARCHITECTURAL REMAINS.</div>

<p class='c000'>In the valley below is a small sandstone ridge,
called Chapel-hill, from the idea that a temple stood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>upon it. Two fine altars have been found here.<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c012'><sup>[108]</sup></a>
The ruins that contained the Mithraic antiquities, to
which reference will be made afterwards, stood a
little to the west of this hill. All traces of the small,
dark temple, where the horrid mysteries of the god
were performed, are now nearly obliterated.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fragments of columns which are engraved in
<a href='#p224b'>Plate XI</a>, enable us to imagine the original grandeur
of the place.<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c012'><sup>[109]</sup></a> With some of the certainty with
which a comparative anatomist decides upon the
character and habits of an animal, from an inspection
of a fragment of its osseous system, an architect
determines the size and style of a building from an
examination of some of its parts. Thus, the circular
column, of which one of the stones (<a href='#p224b'>Plate XI</a>.) that
now lies in the valley below the station, has formed
a part, was probably not less than twenty feet high;
how imposing must the entire temple have been!</p>

<p class='c000'>Plates XII and XIII exhibit several of the carved
figures which formerly lay in confusion among the
ruins of the station. They are interesting, as exhibiting
the state of the arts in Britain at that time,
the mode of dress adopted by the Romans, and the
<span id='p226' class='figleft id029'><img src='images/i_p226.jpg' alt='Figure of Victory' class='ig001' /></span>high degree of attention which they paid to the
decoration of their stations. Roman art in Britain
has surely been rated too low.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>The figure introduced on this page was found here.
It represents one
of old Rome’s most
favourite deities,—Victory,
careering,
with outstretched
wings, over the
globe. How strong
must the passion for
conquest have been
in the breast of a
people, who, though
nurtured in a southern
climate, braved
for more than three
centuries, the fogs,
and storms, and desolation
of this wild
region! Wherever
the winged goddess
led, they followed,
and, most pertinaciously too, maintained their
ground. But, there is a tide in the affairs of men.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>From an inscription found at Castlecary, it appears
that this cohort of Tungrians built one thousand
paces of the Antonine Wall in Scotland. They
were from about Tongres, on the banks of the Mæse,
in Belgic Gaul. Their rank, as a milliary cohort,
conferred on them the dangerous honour of advancing
in the van of the army to battle, and their acknowledged
valour probably procured for them the appointment
to this exposed and dangerous post.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE NAME ASCERTAINED.</div>

<p class='c000'>The etymology of <em>Borcovicus</em> is easy. A high
hill to the south of the station is called Borcum or
Barcomb, a neighbouring stream is designated Bardon-burn,
and a village near its confluence with the
Tyne, Bardon-mill. <i>Bar</i>, in Celtic, means a height,
and probably forms the root of all these names; the
termination, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>vicus</em></span>, is a Latin word, signifying a village.</p>

<p class='c000'>The stone used in the inside of the walls of the
station, and for other ordinary purposes, has been
quarried out of the cliffs in the sandstone ridge,
along which the present military road passes. 'The
altars, columns, and quoins, and much of the ashlar
work, have been taken from a stratum of freestone
on the north side of the Wall, and similar to that in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>which the recesses, called the King and Queen’s
Caves, on the south side of Broomlee-lough, are
formed.'<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c012'><sup>[110]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote c015'>THE VALLUM COMMANDED BY THE CRAGS.</div>
<p class='c000'>Again taking the Wall as our guide, we will pursue
our course westward. For the greater part of
the way along the high ground, the Wall is in a sufficiently
good state of preservation to make it a varied
and interesting study; it not unfrequently exhibits
five, six, and even seven courses of facing-stones. The
Northumbrian lakes also lend a charm to the scene.
Though appearing in native simplicity and rude
grandeur, they will not on that account be less appreciated
by men of taste. The Vallum is generally
very boldly developed, and runs for several miles in
the valley below, completely commanded by the hill
on which the Wall stands, as is shewn in the section,
<a href='#p112b'>Plate IV</a>. This fact is surely fatal to the theory of
its having been erected to withstand the brunt of a
northern foe. It would have been impolitic to
allow the enemy to occupy these heights even as a
post of observation. It is true, that the Vallum is occasionally
commanded by the rising ground on the
south: opposite Sewingshields it is so, and opposite
Hot-bank, a little to the west of where we now are,
it is overlooked on both sides. This difficulty is not
a very formidable one. The engineer of the Barrier
has drawn the Vallum chiefly in straight lines from
one point to another, and has not thought it necessary
to guard with excessive jealousy every little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>rising ground to the south; he never, however, departs
from his course to go round the north of a
hill, as he does to go round the south of that one near
Halton-chesters. The cases, moreover, in which
the Vallum is exposed to observation from the south,
are very few. Horsley’s own testimony upon this
point is decided. He writes—</p>

<p class='c014'>It must be owned, that the southern prospect of Hadrian’s
work, and the defence on that side, is generally better than
on the north; whereas the northern prospect and defence
have been principally, or only taken care of in the Wall of
Severus.<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c012'><sup>[111]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>RAPISHAW-GAP.</div>

<p class='c000'>After passing a mile-castle we come to a depression
in the ridge of basalt, that places us opposite
the west end of Broomlee-lough; the crag on the
west side of this slack is called Cuddy’s-crag. A
little farther on, we reach a more extensive pass,
called Rapishaw-gap; a road passes through it
under the same circumstances as that through Busy-gap,
a little above the bottom of the valley. The
traveller may here with advantage go to the north of
the Wall, in order to examine the geological
character of the cliffs he has passed; they are seen
‘to rise in rude and pillared majesty.’</p>

<p class='c000'>Regaining the high grounds, the Wall for a short
space is found to possess less than its usual interest;
the ground on the east side of the Bradley estate
was formerly common, and the object of our study
was every man’s prey. Other objects of inquiry,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>however, abundantly relieve the attention. Langley
castle, on the south bank of the Tyne, is in sight,
and during our western journey will long continue
to be so. It is a square building strengthened by
rectangular towers at the corners. Formerly a seat of
the Percys, it became afterwards the property of the
Radcliffes. It passed, on the rebellion of 1715, along
with the other possessions of the earl of Derwentwater,
into the hands of the commissioners of Greenwich
Hospital, who at present retain it. Destroyed by fire
at an early period, it has never been repaired; its
masonry is notwithstanding in excellent preservation.
On a clear day the singularly strong tongue
of land on which are the ruins of Staward-le-peel,
may also be discerned to the south. But, more to
our present purpose, the high, brown hill of Borcum,
from which the Romans obtained much of the stone
used in the construction of this part of the Wall, is in
the foreground. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>ANCIENT QUARRY<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> An interesting discovery was made
here in 1837, to which subsequent reference will be
made. On opening an ancient quarry on the top of it,
near the ‘longstone,’ a workman found a small copper
vessel, containing a large number of Roman coins;
four of these were of the time of Hadrian, and all
the rest, of previous reigns. Those of Trajan and
Hadrian were as fresh as if new from the die. The
conclusion is natural, that the quarry had been last
wrought in the time of Hadrian, the Wall itself being
possibly of the same date. An extensive earthen camp
is on the summit of the hill, probably raised by the
soldiers who were engaged in quarrying the rock.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>Greenlee-lough is to the north; on its western
margin is a modern structure, Bonny-rig, the property
of sir Edward Blackett.</p>

<p class='c000'>Proceeding westward, the Wall again rises into
notice. ‘Much of it remains of very various thicknesses,
the whole of the perpendicular outsets and
insets being on the south side.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'>HADRIAN SLAB.</div>

<p class='c000'>On the tail of the crag on which we now are, the
farm-house of Bradley stands. Built up in the
doorway of its old kitchen, was a stone, now at
Matfen, bearing the fragment of an inscription.
Another fractured slab, formerly in the possession
of the ‘judicious’ Warburton, and now at Durham,
when joined to it, gives an inscription precisely similar
to one immediately to be noticed, with the exception
of a letter or two in the line of the fracture.
The fragments, doubtless, as Hodgson conjectures,
formed one stone, deposited in the foundation of some
castellum in this neighbourhood, as a memorial of its
erection by Hadrian. The wood-cut annexed has
been prepared from drawings carefully made of the
two portions in their separate localities.</p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>BRADLEY HALL.</div>

<p class='c000'>Once, at least, since the days of Hadrian, this
central region of the Wall has been honoured with
the presence of royalty. Hodgson says,—</p>

<p class='c014'>On the authority of documents in Rymer, Prynne, and the
Calender of Patent Rolls, I find Edward the First testing records
in the presence of several great officers of state, at Lanchester,
on Aug. 10; at Corbridge, Aug. 14; at Newburgh,
Aug. 28, 30, 31, and Sep. 4; at Bradley ‘in Marchia Scotiæ,’
Sep. 6 and 7; at Haltwhistle on the 11th, and at Thirlwall
on the 20th of the same month; and at Lanercost on Oct. 4,
A.D. 1306, at which last house he continued all winter. The
Bradley here mentioned is probably Bradley-hall, on the right
bank of Craglough-burn, and a little south both of Vallum
and Wall, not the farm-house of Bradley, which is between
the two barriers.—<cite>Northd.</cite> II. iii. 288.</p>

<p class='c000'>The exigencies of war have again and again drawn
to this secluded spot the mightiest potentates of
earth; as yet this imperial ground has not been
trodden by the feet of Majesty, attracted by the sweet
allurements of peace.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the margin of the military road, opposite to us,
is the only Inn in the district, which is known by no
other name than that of <em>Twice Brewed</em>. Before the
construction of the Railway it was much resorted to
by the carriers who conducted the traffic between
the eastern and western portions of the island. As
many as fifty horses and about twenty men would
be put up here for the night. Now, it is nearly forsaken.
Hutton took up his abode here on a carrier’s
night. The difficulty he had in procuring an exclusive
bed was compensated by the amusement of observing
the carriers at their meal—he soon perceived
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>that they had ‘no barricade in the throat; and became
convinced that eating was the chief end of man!’</p>

<div class='sidenote'>MILKING-GAP.</div>
<p class='c000'>The next break in the basaltic ridge, is the
Milking-gap. As we approach it, Crag-lough is
seen laving the base of the perpendicular cliff
along which the Wall runs. In order to take the
high ground, westward of the gap, the Wall here
turns at a considerable angle. In this valley, the
north fosse again comes to the help of the structure.
In front of the farm-house, called Hot-bank,
are distinct traces of a mile-castle. In taking up its
foundations, the slab, of which the annexed drawing
is a faithful copy, was found, which would seem to
be a tablet precisely similar to that which is formed
by the junction of the two fragments referred to above.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>Of all the inscriptions discovered in Britain, Hodgson
pronounces this to be of the greatest historical
importance, inasmuch as it leads to the true reading
of several fragments of similar inscriptions throwing<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>MILKING-GAP INSCRIPTION.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
light upon the authorship of the Wall. One of
these was known to Horsley, and seems to have puzzled
that great antiquary. It and other fragments which
have since been found in different mile-castles, tend to
produce the conviction, that the mile-castles, (which
are on the line of the Wall, ascribed to Severus,)
were built by Hadrian. The simplicity of the inscription
will strike the classical reader, who will
not fail also to observe the peculiarity of the name
of the emperor being in the genitive case.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although the station of <em>Vindolana</em> lies considerably
to the south of the lines of the Barrier, it is
ranked by the Notitia among the stations <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>per lineam
valli</em></span>, and as such, must be examined by us in our
mural peregrination. Leaving Milking-gap with
this view, and crossing the low grounds to the
south of the Wall, the Vallum is observed, contrary
to its usual tendency, making two rapid curves,
something in the form of the letter S, to avoid, apparently,
the swellings of the contiguous marsh. At
High-shields, a cottage on the little ridge south of
the turnpike-road, the station comes into view. It
stands upon a partially detached eminence, surrounded,
though not so closely as to be commanded, by
hills of superior elevation. On all sides, except the
western, it is naturally defended, whilst the summits
of the surrounding heights afford it a degree of shelter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>which would be peculiarly grateful to the natives
of southern Europe. The Chineley-burn flows past it,
and the situation is altogether one of peculiar beauty.
In modern times, the place has been variously designated
Little Chesters, the Bowers, and Chesterholm.</p>

<div class='sidenote c015'>VINDOLANA.</div>
<p class='c000'>VINDOLANA.—As this station is detached
from the Wall, and lies upon the line of the ancient
road which ran from <span class='sc'>Cilurnum</span> to <span class='sc'>Magna</span>,
it is not improbable that it was one of Agricola’s
forts. The road which connected it with the Wall
may yet be distinctly traced between High Shields
and the farm-house of Chesterholm.</p>

<p class='c000'>The walls, ditches, and gateways of the station
are all discernible. The northern gateway would
be the one chiefly used by the garrison, as it opens
directly upon the Great Military Way. An examination
of the western gateway, some years ago,
led to the belief that it had been walled up at an
early period; this is the most exposed side of the
camp. A portion of the wall of the station near the
north-east corner, when cleared by its late owner,
Mr. Hedley, stood twelve courses high. In this
case, as in many others, the researches of the antiquary
have only facilitated the operations of the
destroyer; much of it has since been removed.
The size of the stones, which is considerable in the
foundation course, gradually diminishes upwards.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>CHESTERHOLM.</div>

<p class='c000'>At least two buildings provided with hypocausts,
have been discovered here. One of these stood
about fifty yards beyond the western rampart, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>when discovered, contained a square apartment,
vaulted above. Some of the vaulting-stones are
still preserved at Chesterholm; they are grooved
near the lower extremity, apparently to allow of the
joints being strengthened by the insertion between
them of keys of slate or wood. The remains of
this building were more complete when Hodgson
wrote the following paragraph than at present:—</p>

<p class='c014'>The pillars of the hypocaust are still very black with fire
and soot; and people say that the Bowers, from the Roman
age till within the last century, was the elysium of a colony of
fairies; and this ruined bath, the kitchen to one of their palaces,
of which the soot among the stones was undeniable
evidence; and confident belief affirmed, that long passages
led from this laboratory of savoury messes to subterranean
halls that ever echoed to the festivities and music of the
Queen of the Bowers, and her aërial court.</p>

<div id='p237'  class='figright id013'>
<img src='images/i_p237.jpg' alt='Altar to Fortune, Chesterholm' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>The other hypocaust was partially explored by
Warburton in 1717, but
more fully by the rev.
Ant. Hedley in 1831. It
stood within the area
of the camp not far from
the eastern gateway. In
its ruins, Warburton
found the fine altar to
Fortune, here engraved.
It is now preserved in the
Library of the Dean and
Chapter at Durham, the
‘judicious’ antiquary not
having been able to obtain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>his price for it of my lord Oxford.<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c012'><sup>[112]</sup></a> Here
also Mr. Hedley discovered the three noble altars
<span id='p238' class='figright id019'><img src='images/i_p238.jpg' alt='Hypocaust Pillar' class='ig001' /></span>which are still preserved at Chesterholm. The
pillars which supported the
floor of the hypocausts were
of different shapes and diameters;
some of them were portions
of square columns, as in
the annexed example, some
circular, like the balusters of
stairs, as may be seen by the
specimens of them in the garden
at Chesterholm. The Romans
themselves, Hodgson
remarks, seem to have treated the fallen works of their
predecessors here with very little ceremony, when
they cut down the handsome columns of halls and
temples into pillars for sooty hypocausts.</p>

<p class='c000'>About a furlong west of the camp is a copious
spring, from which the water was taken by a channel
formed of large stones into the station. The
water still, in some measure, follows its ancient
track, as the appearance of the herbage shews, and
pours itself, by a covered passage, into the Chineley-burn
on the opposite side.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>In the vicinity of the camp is an object of peculiar
interest. On the line of the ancient Roman road
which skirts its northern rampart, stands a mile-stone
at the spot where the soldiers of Agricola or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>Hadrian placed it. The opposite lithograph shews
it in the foreground; the camp is in the distance.
It is upwards of six feet high, and is nearly two feet
in diameter. There are traces of an inscription on
its western face, but scarcely a letter can now be deciphered.<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>ROMAN MILE-STONE.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Another mile-stone formerly stood to
the west of this, but it was removed and split up by
its tasteless owner, into two gate-posts. Horsley
says that it bore the inscription—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c017'>
    <div>BONO REIPVBLICÆ NATO.</div>
    <div>To one born for the good of the republic—</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>an inscription which, supposing it to be perfect,
though this is a little doubtful, is happily contrived to
be complimentary to each successive emperor. The
Romans, with wise policy, paid great attention to their
roads; the stones which they erected at every mile
were generally inscribed with the name of the consul
or emperor under whose auspices they were made.
Horsley mentions another mile-stone, which was to
the east of the present one.</p>

<p class='c000'>Close by the mile-stone is a tumulus of considerable
size.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the house and grounds of the late Mr. Hedley,
are preserved some very valuable antiquarian remains.
A very fine altar to Jupiter is reserved for
subsequent description. Another, whose focus is
reddened by the action of fire, is here introduced
on account of the evidence which it affords, in corroboration
of the conjecture of Horsley, that Little
Chesters was the <span class='sc'>Vindolana</span> of the Romans, where,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>according to the Notitia, the fourth cohort of the
Gauls was stationed.</p>

<p class='c000'>preserved at the place, and
of which an engraving is here

presence of the twentieth legion
also, which was surnamed
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='fss'>V[ALENS] V[ICTRIX]</span></span>, ‘the valiant and victorious’, and
of which the symbol was a boar. This legion was first
sent over to Britain by Claudius, and remained in
it until the island was abandoned by the Romans.
Horsley conceives that this legion was concerned in
the erection of the Vallum, though, he adds, we have
no inscriptions to prove it. He suspects that it was no-way
concerned in building the Wall, because, among
all the centurial inscriptions which had come under
his notice, not one mentioned this legion, or any
cohort belonging to it. The discovery, since the
publication of the Britannia Romana, of this and
other memorials to be noticed as we proceed, renders</p>

<img src='images/i_p241b.jpg' alt='alt=Part of Slab to Hadrian' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c000'>it probable that the twentieth legion was engaged
upon both the Wall and the Vallum;
and as, according to Horsley,
‘it is evident that this legion
was at Chester in the year 154,’
where it long continued, the probability
is strengthened, that the
Wall, as well as the Vallum, was built before that
period. A fragment of an inscription, represented
above, bears direct reference to Hadrian. The
Milking-gap slab, to which it has a very close resemblance,
enables us to supply the parts that are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>wanting. The only difference seems to be, that the
emperor’s name is in the dative case instead of the
genitive as in the other example.</p>

In addition to the altars

them is a range of Roman coping-stones,

the stones has been alluded to previously.</p>

<p class='c000'>Near the stables attached to the house, is a Roman

</div>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'>VINDOLANA</div>

<p class='c000'>The probable meaning of the word <span class='sc'>Vindolana</span>,
is ‘the hill of arms;’ <em>vin</em>, with slight variations of
pronunciation, signifying, in all the Celtic dialects, a
height; and <em>lann</em>, in the Gaelic, weapons. The name
well accords with those common in Ossian’s poems.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>Rejoining the Wall at Milking-gap, and continuing
our course westward, we soon arrive at a
conspicuous gap, on the Steel-rig grounds. The
Wall on the eastern declivity of this pass may
be studied to great advantage. The courses are
laid parallel to the horizon; the mortar of each
course of the interior seems to have been smoothed
over before the superincumbent mass was added. In
order to give the in-door antiquary an idea of its condition,
a drawing of it is here introduced.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>PEEL-CRAG.</div>

<p class='c000'>Mounting another hill, and again descending into
the valley, we find another gap, in which the remains
of a mile-castle will be noticed, from which it has
received the name of the Castle-nick. A little farther
removed is Peel-crag, one of the most precipitous
faces which the Wall has had to traverse.
The military way ingeniously avoids the
sudden descent by winding round the southern
projections of the rock. After passing a cottage,
called the Peel, a modern road is encountered
which leads to Keilder, and so into Scotland; in
its progress northwards, however, it soon degenerates
into a mere track. As this pass is more than
usually open, the fosse again appears surmounted by
a mound on its northern margin; the earth-works
are strongly marked, but the Wall is gone.</p>

<p class='c000'>The lithographic view represents the northern
aspect of the crags, as they appear here.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the western side of this, sheltered by a few
trees, is the farm-house of Steel-rig. Attaining the
next elevation—Winshields-crag—we are on ground
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>reputed to be the highest between the two seas; a turf
cairn has been erected on it for the purposes of the ordnance
survey. From this lofty summit, the vessels navigating
the Solway may easily be descried.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>BLOODY-GAP.</div>

<p class='c000'>Proceeding in the same direction, we reach another
gap of wide dimensions, but very steep on both declivities.
Here the Wall has been provided with a ditch,
strengthened, as usual in dangerous situations, with
a rampart on its outer margin. If the local vocabulary
does not furnish this pass with a name (and I
have not been able to find that it does), Bloody-gap,
from the following circumstance, well befits it.
Nearly direct north from it, is a rising ridge of
ground, called Scotch-coulthard. When the moss-troopers,
who abounded in these parts, succeeded in
safely reaching it, their pursuers commonly considered
farther chase useless. Between the Wall and this
point of safety, therefore, the race and the conflict
were necessarily of the most desperate character;
that many deadly conflicts have taken place, is
evidenced by the numerous skeletons which are
turned up in draining the ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>A lonely cottage, upon an exposed part of the
ridge, is called Shield-on-the-Wall.</p>

<p class='c000'>Near the modern military way, two large stones,
called ‘the mare and foal,’ are standing. In Armstrong’s
map of Northumberland, three are marked;
they are probably remains of a Druidical circle.</p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>ANCIENT TRADITIONS.</div>

<p class='c000'>Shortly afterwards we come to a gap of very
bold proportions. Popular faith asserts it to have
been the abode of evil spirits, and it is known by
the ominous name of Bogle-hole. The sides of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>gap are steep; on the western declivity the courses
of the Wall are for the most part conformable to
the ground, but they are stayed up by occasional
steps parallel to the horizon. In the valley, to the
south, the Vallum is seen bending up towards the
Wall, apparently to assist in defending the pass; it
would not have done so, had it been an independent
fortification. The vicinity of Bogle-hole seems a
fitting place for introducing the following passage
from Procopius, a writer of the fifth century. We
can readily conceive that at a period when the inroads
of the Caledonians were still fresh in the
memory of the inhabitants, the country north of the
Wall would be regarded with superstitious dread.
Doubtless, many who passed the boundary, found, to
their cost, that in this region lay the pathway to
the world of spirits:—</p>

<p class='c014'>Moreover, in this isle of Brittia, men of ancient time built
a long wall, cutting off a great portion of it: for the soil, and
the man, and all other things, are not alike on both sides;
for on the eastern (southern) side of the Wall, there is a
wholesomeness of air in conformity with the seasons, moderately
warm in summer, and cool in winter. Many men inhabit
here, living much as other men. The trees, with their
appropriate fruits, flourish in season, and their corn lands are
as productive as others; and the district appears sufficiently
fertilized by streams. But on the western (northern) side
all is different, insomuch indeed, that it would be impossible
for a man to live there, even half an hour. Vipers and serpents
innumerable, with all other kinds of wild beasts, infest
that place; and, what is most strange, the natives affirm,
that if any one, passing the Wall, should proceed to the other
side, he would die immediately, unable to endure the unwholesomeness
of the atmosphere. Death also, attacking such
beasts as go thither, forthwith destroys them.... They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>say that the souls of men departed are always conducted
to this place; but in what manner I will explain immediately,
having frequently heard it from men of that region relating
it most seriously, although I would rather ascribe their asseverations
to a certain dreamy faculty which possesses them.—<cite>Giles’s
Ancient Britons</cite>, I. 404.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>CAW-GAP.</div>

<p class='c000'>The next defile is Caw-gap; some ruined cottages,
formed of Wall-stones, stand in it. The extreme
jealousy with which the Romans defended an exposed
situation is well shewn here. The fosse,
which guards the pass through the low ground, is
discontinued on the western side as soon as the
Wall attains a sufficient elevation, but upon the
the ground drooping, though only for the space of
a few yards, it re-appears for that short distance.</p>

<p class='c000'>A road runs through this pass to the north, which
soon becomes a mere track. It passes a solitary
house, called Burn Deviot, nearly due north from
the gap, which was long the resort of smugglers and
sheep-stealers. The memory of its last tenants,
Nell Nichol and her two daughters, who were a pest
to the country, is still fresh in the district. Though
many years have elapsed since any one occupied the
dwelling, lights are said often to be seen at the windows
at night, visible tokens of the presence of the
spirits of the murdered children of Nell’s daughters.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>CAWFIELDS CRAGS.</div>

<p class='c000'>The crags along which we soon find ourselves to
be proceeding, possess a perpendicular elevation of
nearly five hundred feet above the plains below.
Passing another small gap, called the Thorny Doors,
we come to a tract of Wall in an excellent state
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>of preservation. The lower courses have lately
been freed from the rubbish which for centuries
has covered them, and the fallen stones replaced
in their proper order. The whole face of the
Wall has a remarkably fresh appearance, and
nowhere can the tooling of the stones be examined
with more advantage. Amongst the fallen stones,
one was lately found which furnishes us with additional
evidence, that the twentieth legion was engaged
in the erection of this part of the Wall. It</p>
<div id='p247'  class='figright id032'>
<img src='images/i_p247.jpg' alt='alt=Mural Stone, Leg. XX. V.V.' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c000'>is preserved amongst the antiquities
at Chesters, and is
represented in the adjoining
cut. This sculpture
cannot have been derived
from the Vallum, in the
construction of which, in the time of Hadrian, the
twentieth legion is acknowledged to have been
employed; for the Vallum is here distant more than
three hundred yards from the Wall. The reader
will of course perceive the bearing which this fact
has upon the question of the contemporaneous origin
of the two structures, and the construction of the
Wall, as well as the Vallum, by Hadrian.</p>

<p class='c000'>While the antiquary is eagerly scrutinizing indentations
in stones which were chiselled sixteen centuries
ago, his eye will occasionally rest upon the memorials
of an antiquity so indefinite as to throw
into the shade even his primeval records. Lepidodendra,
and other fossils of the mill-stone-grit and coal
series, are of occasional occurrence. Who shall tell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>when these giant plants flourished, how they were
enveloped in their sandy bed, and how hardened into
the flinty stone made use of by the Roman soldiers?
Imagination reels at the questions suggested.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>PILGRIMS'-GAP.</div>

<p class='c000'>We are now arrived at the most perfect mile-castle
remaining on the line, generally named, from
the farm-house to the north of it, the Cawfields
Castle. The gap which it guarded was denominated
by the peripatetic party of 1849, in commemoration
of their visit, the Pilgrims’-gap, a name which is
beginning to be recognised by the inhabitants of the
neighbourhood.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE CAWFIELDS CASTELLUM.</div>

<p class='c000'>Until recently, the castellum was nearly covered
with its own ruins. Since the annexed drawing was
taken, the rubbish has been entirely removed from
the inside, as well as the out.</p>

<p class='c000'>The building is a parallelogram, but the corners
at its lower side are rounded off. It measures, inside,
sixty-three feet from east to west, and forty-nine
feet from north to south. The great Wall forms its
northern side. The stones used in the construction
of this building are of the same size and character
as those employed in the Wall itself; the mortar has
disappeared from between the courses of the facing-stones,
but portions of lime are seen in the grout of
the interior. In the western wall, nine courses of
stones are standing. The side walls of the castle
have not been tied to the great Wall, but have been
brought close up to it, and the junction cemented
with mortar.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It is provided with a gateway of large dimensions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>both on its northern and southern side. In
Horsley’s day, it was a matter of doubt whether
there was any opening through the Wall, excepting
at the points where the Watling-street and the
Maiden-way crossed it; the disinterment of this
mile-castle sets the question at rest, and justifies us
in believing that the passages at Busy-gap, Rapishaw-gap,
and other places, are of Roman formation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The gateways are formed of large slabs of rustic
masonry, and to give them full development, the
walls are thicker here than in other parts. The
width of the wall at the lower gateway is nine feet
three inches; at the upper, which was, of course,
the more exposed, ten feet six inches. The opening
of each gateway is ten feet. Two folding-doors have
closed the entrance, which, when thrown back, have
fallen into recesses prepared for them. Some of the
pivot holes of the doors remain, which exhibit a
circular chafing, and are slightly tinged with the
oxide of iron. The security of the northern gateway
did not entirely depend upon the solidity of its
masonry, or the strength of its doors. It opens upon
a sort of cliff, and the road from it does not lead
directly away, but runs for a little distance under
the Wall, so as to give an opportunity of more
readily acting against an enemy.</p>

<p class='c000'>The masonry of the whole building, but particularly
of the gateways, is peculiarly fresh. The lines
that have been lightly chiselled on some of the large
rustic slabs of the gateways, in order to guide the
workmen in correctly placing those above which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>project less than than the others, are still quite distinct.
The stone is of a very durable nature,
but it is difficult to conceive how such slender
markings, particularly when in a horizontal position,
could long resist the action of the weather.
Were we to judge only from the appearance of the
masonry, we might be led to suppose that the building
had been enveloped in its own ruins not long
after its erection—perhaps in that dreadful irruption
of the Caledonians which brought Severus to this
country—and that it was never afterwards repaired.</p>

<p class='c000'>In clearing out the interior of this building, no
traces of party-walls, of a substantial character at
least, were found. It stands upon a slope of about
one foot in five, and, towards the hanging side of it,
the ground has been rendered horizontal by ‘made
earth.’ Some fragments of gray slate, pierced for
roofing, were found among the rubbish; it is therefore
not improbable that a shed was laid against the
southern wall for the protection of the soldiers. At
about the elevation which the raised floor would
reach, the Wall is, in one place, eaten away by the
action of fire. Here, probably, was the hearth round
which the shivering soldiers of the south clustered,
to forget, in the recital of their country’s tales, the
fierce Caledonians who prowled around them, or the
still fiercer tempests, which all their valour and all
their engineering skill could not exclude from their
dwellings. With the exception of such sheds, or mere
temporary erections, the whole building seems to have
been open above. Two large fragments of funereal slabs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>were found in the castellum; one of them has been
roughly shaped into a circular form, and is reddened
by fire; the letters which remain are distinct and
well formed. Has it been the hearth? The inscription
has been erased from the other. Another stone of
still greater interest was found here, furnishing additional
<span id='p251' class='figright id033'><img src='images/i_p251.jpg' alt='Part of Slab to Hadrian' class='ig001' /></span>evidence of the erection of the mile-castles
by Hadrian. From the annexed cut,
it will at once be perceived that it
is a duplicate of the inscription,
already described, in which the second
legion endeavours to perpetuate its
name, and those of its emperor,
Hadrian, and Aulus Platorius Nepos,
his legate. There cannot be a doubt
that the castellum and the Wall were built at the
same time, and by the same parties; if Hadrian
therefore built the one, the other is erroneously
ascribed to Severus.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two small silver coins were found amongst the
rubbish within the castellum, one of Vespasian, the
other of Marcus Aurelius. Although their testimony
is of a negative character, it will be observed,
that it is not inconsistent with the idea, that the
castle was erected in the time of Hadrian, and with
the opinion already hazarded, that it was dismantled
at an early period. There were also found large pieces
of earthen-ware, chiefly of the coarser kinds, and
fragments of millstones formed of lava, which shew
that culinary operations were carried on within these
cold, bare walls, and a solitary oyster-shell among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>the rubbish bore testimony to the attachment of the
Romans to this article of luxury. The mile-castle
is very nearly midway between the seas.</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides the articles already enumerated, there
were picked up within the castellum some large glass
beads of somewhat singular appearance, (<a href='#p170c'>Plate VII</a>.,
figs. 7, 8) and a fibula of brass. The whole of these
relics are safely deposited in the collection of antiquities
at Chesters. The interesting building is,
happily, upon an estate belonging to John Clayton,
esq.; the hand of the spoiler will therefore not be
allowed to touch it.</p>

<p class='c000'>About one hundred and fifty yards south of the castellum,
is a spring of excellent water. Near it, about
midway between the Vallum and the Wall, an altar
to Apollo was lately discovered, which will afterwards
be described.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>TEMPORARY CAMP.</div>

<p class='c000'>A road leads from the vicinity of the mile-castle
to the town of Haltwhistle, in the sheltered valley of
the Tyne, whither, should the shades of evening be
approaching, the way-worn antiquary may be glad to
bend his steps. At the point where the path joins the
modern military road, a Roman camp will be observed.
On the sides which are most exposed,
double and triple lines of earth-works have been
raised. The rock on the western face of the ground
where the camp stands, has been wrought by the
Romans for stones, and the camp has given them temporary
protection. It was here that the inscription
on the face of the rock, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='fss'>LEG. VI. V.</span></span>, was discovered
in 1847, as already mentioned, page 81. The quarry,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>not being required for the use of the district, was
shortly afterwards closed.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>HALTWHISTLE.</div>

<p class='c000'>The Castle-hill at Haltwhistle is, apparently, a diluvial
deposit; ramparts, still quite distinct, run round
the margin of its summit. Several peel-houses in the
town and its vicinity, will interest the antiquary.<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c012'><sup>[113]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>To those who cherish the religious views of the
early Anglican reformers, it will be interesting to
remember, that this is the native district of Nicholas
Ridley, bishop and martyr. Willimoteswick-castle,
his reputed birth-place, is on the south bank of the
Tyne, about three miles below Haltwhistle.<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c012'><sup>[114]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>HALTWHISTLE-BURN-HEAD.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>Rejoining the Wall, Haltwhistle-burn-head is the
first object of interest that we meet with in our course
westward. The burn, to which important reference
will presently be made, is derived from the overflowings
of Greenlee-lough. Between its source, and
the gap by which it passes the ridge on which the
Wall stands, it is called the Caw-burn; below that
point it bears the name of Haltwhistle-burn.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the width of the defile, and the passage of the
stream, render this a weak point in the barrier, the
two lines of fortification approach very near to each
other; they afterwards again diverge.</p>

<p class='c000'>Westward of Burn-head farm-house, the fosse is
boldly developed, but the Wall is traceable only in
the ruins of its foundation. As we proceed onwards
to Great Chesters, the foundations of a mile-castle
which has stood half to the north of the Wall, and
half within it, may be, though not without careful
scrutiny, observed. The tower which formerly stood
at Portgate is the only other known example of a
similar arrangement.</p>

<div class='sidenote c015'>GREAT CHESTERS.</div>

<p class='c000'>ÆSICA, or Great Chesters, is the tenth stationary
camp on the line of the Wall. Its superficial contents
are 3 acres, 35 poles. The ramparts and fosse
are clearly defined. The southern gateway may be
traced; it is nearer the eastern than the western
side. A double rampart of earth seems to have
given additional security to the western side, which,
by situation, is the weakest. A vaulted room in the
centre of the camp still answers very correctly to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>the description given of it in 1800 by Dr. Lingard,
(quoted by Hodgson, II. iii. 203.)</p>

<p class='c014'>It is 6½ feet square, and 5 feet high. It was descended by
steps, and had, at the opposite end to its entrance, a sort of
bench, raised on mason work, 2½ feet wide and high, and covered
with a slab of stone. The roof consisted of six similar
and contiguous arches of stone, each 15 inches broad. It had
also one pillar. The floor had on it a great quantity of ashes,
was flagged, and on raising one of the stones, a spring gushed
out, which converted the vault into a well.</p>

<p class='c000'>About one hundred and fifty yards south of the
station, in a field which has for years been furrowed
by the plough, the remains of a building of somewhat
rude construction have just been discovered. Its
floor, consisting, for the most part, of the usual
compost, is nearly a foot thick. Further examination
would probably disclose, in its vicinity, the
foundations of numerous suburban buildings.</p>

<p class='c000'>An ancient road leads from the southern gateway
of the station to the great military way which ran
from <span class='sc'>Cilurnum</span> to <span class='sc'>Magna</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>ÆSICA.</div>

<p class='c000'>The station of <span class='sc'>Æsica</span>, according to the Notitia, was
about the year 430, garrisoned by the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>cohors prima
Astorum</em></span>.<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c012'><sup>[115]</sup></a> Horsley (writing in 1731) observes, that no
inscriptions had been found here mentioning the first
cohort of the Asti, or any other cohort. In 1761, however,
an inscription was dug up in this station, which is
now deposited in the museum at Newcastle-upon-Tyne,
recording that in the reign of Alexander
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>Severus (200 years before the date of the Notitia)
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘cohors secunda Asturum’</span> rebuilt a granary
here which had fallen into decay from age—<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘horreum
vetustate conlabsum.’</span> It is to be observed that the
spelling of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Asturum’</span> is similar to that of the inscription
at <span class='sc'>Cilurnum</span>, and we do not find that the <em>second</em>
cohort, either of the Asti or Astures, is mentioned
elsewhere as part of the Roman auxiliary forces in
Britain.</p>

<p class='c000'>Near the eastern gateway of the station there has
been lately dug up a large mural tablet, shewn in
the wood-cut, and bearing the following inscription:</p>

<div id='p256'  class='figcenter id034'>
<img src='images/i_p256.jpg' alt='Tablet to Hadrian' class='ig001' />

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It is not probable that this slab has been derived
from the Vallum, which is upwards of a quarter of a
mile from the station.<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c012'><sup>[116]</sup></a> Why the upper part of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>tablet was left blank does not appear; enough,
however, has been inserted to support the theory,
that Hadrian built the Wall. Although several of
the stations were probably built before the Wall,
and were quite independent of it, this can scarcely
have been one of them; its position seems to indicate
that it was called into existence in order to
accommodate the mural garrison.</p>

</div>
</div>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>ETYMOLOGY OF ÆSICA.</div>

<p class='c000'>Celtic authorities all agree in tracing the name
<span class='sc'>Æsica</span> to a word signifying <em>water</em>. The propriety
of such an appellation does not at first sight appear.
The camp is far from either the eastern or western
sea; no lake is visible from its ramparts; the only
water which is near is the Haltwhistle-burn, a
somewhat tiny stream. The low ground to the
south has a fenny aspect, but the station itself stands
high and dry, though upon a part of the mural
ridge less elevated than usual. It is not improbable
that it may have derived its name from an aqueduct
which leads the water from the Greenlee-lough to
the camp. As this water-course has hitherto escaped
the notice of writers upon the Wall, and is a work
of considerable interest, a somewhat detailed description
of it may be allowable.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c021'>
    <div>THE WATER-COURSE AT ÆSICA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The camp, though not greatly elevated, stands higher than
the ground, either north or south of it. The country to the
north, though generally flat, is studded with numerous hills
of moderate elevation. On the sides of some of these,
about two-thirds up, may be noticed a line that reminds
the spectator of the parallel roads in Glenroy and other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>places. On examination, it is found to be an artificial
cutting, made with evident reference to the maintenance of
the water level. The sections given in <a href='#p444d'>Plate XVI</a>.,
shew its size and form. In some places the water stands in
it yet; in others a mass of peat fills it; and very frequently,
where the channel has been obliterated, its course is shewn by
a line of rushes, which grow on the damp ground. Wherever
the water-course can be distinctly discerned, it has
been laid down in the accompanying plan by a green line;
where the traces of it are lost, the line of the water level
has been pursued, and is indicated by dots of the same
colour.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE WATER-COURSE.</div>

<p class='c014'>The whole length of the water-course is six miles; the
distance in a straight line is little more than two miles and
a quarter. It takes its commencement at the Saughy-rig-washpool,
which is formed by the occasional damming up of
the Caw-burn, at about a mile from its exit from the Greenlee-lough.
In the immediate vicinity of the burn, the side of
the water-course next the rivulet which would be endangered
by the overflowing of the natural stream, is made up with flat
stones put in endwise, some of which still remain as shewn in
the section at B, in the plan. In its course to the station, in
order at once to preserve the level, and avoid the necessity of
using forced embankments or stone aqueducts, it is taken
along the sides of the moderately elevated hills which rise
from the plain. So ingeniously is this done, that once only
has it been necessary to cross a valley by an artificial mound
of earth. This has been at a spot between the third and
fourth mile of the water-course, and which is still known in
the district by the name of Benks-bridge, though probably
few of the inhabitants are aware of the evident origin of the
term. Some ingenuity has been employed in fixing the site
of this mound. It is placed in that part of the valley where
there is a slight descent on each side of it; the drainage of
the surface is thus provided for without the use of a culvert;
the surface water on the west, naturally making for the Halt-whistle-burn,
that on the east for the river Tipalt. The mound
which has taken the water-course across the valley at Benks-bridge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>has entirely disappeared, having probably been absorbed,
in the course of ages, by the mossy ground on which it stood.
The whole fall of the water-course, reckoning from the Wash-pool
to the bottom of the arched chamber in the centre of the
station is thirty feet. This is distributed over its entire
length in the way shewn in the following table:—</p>

<p class='c014'>The nature of the ground threw considerable difficulties in
the way of the engineer, which accounts for the exceedingly
tortuous nature of the track pursued. It is indeed remarkable
that without the aid of accurate levelling instruments,
any one could be so fully assured that the requisite fall existed
as to venture upon the task of its formation. The
workmen in the execution of the design probably drew the
water along with them as they proceeded. In one place, (G)
they seem to have made too free with the fall, and after
proceeding for some distance, (upwards of a furlong) have
retraced their steps, and constructed the cutting at a
higher level. In crossing the valleys, there is sometimes an
unusual loss of fall. This is particularly the case at the third
mile (E) where there is a difference in the level of the course,
on the opposite side of the slack, of nearly ten feet. This
valley is permeated by a streamlet, and to take the water
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>across it at the level previously preserved, a stone aqueduct
would have been necessary. Appearances seem to indicate
that an easier plan was adopted. A dam being formed across
the hanging side of the valley, the water of the course was
allowed to deliver itself freely into it, and eventually rising
after the manner of a mill-head to the level of the course on
the western side, pursued its way as before. That this plan
was the result of a change in the design of the architect
seems evident, for on the eastern side of the valley a second
cutting (E) has been made at a lower level than the other,
apparently with the view of leading the water more gradually
to the lower point.</p>

<p class='c014'>Unfortunately all traces of the water-course are lost for
some distance before approaching the station, so that it cannot
be ascertained where it entered it, if it did so at all.</p>

<p class='c014'>That some important object was gained by the formation
of so long a cutting is undoubted, but what that object was
is a perplexing question. It can scarcely be supposed that
the garrison at <span class='sc'>Æsica</span> were dependent for their daily supply
of so important an article as water upon an open cutting outside
the Barrier. The feeblest of their foes could, in an instant,
cut off the provision. No doubt the country, for some distance
north of the Wall, was held in subjection by the Roman
forces, but when the Wall was built, and the station planned,
such was not the case. The station itself is not destitute of
water. A well, sunk some years ago, to the depth of twenty-four
feet, yields to the tenants of the farm-house an unfailing
supply. I am disposed to think that the water brought by
the cutting was to give to the north rampart of the station
the advantage of a wet ditch. By throwing an embankment
across the depression on the north of the station, as it begins
to slope down to the bed of the Haltwhistle-burn, a considerable
body of water would lodge here. The station of <span class='sc'>Æsica</span>
was an important one. In a particularly wild district, at an
unusual distance from the great lines of Roman communication,
and close beside the great opening in the mural ridge,
by which the waters of the Forest of Lowes effect a passage
to the low grounds, it would be peculiarly exposed to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>attacks of the enemy. Although somewhat elevated above
the ground north of the Wall, it is not so much so as to be
impregnable on that quarter. A body of water collected here
to keep the enemy at a still greater distance might not be
beneath the attention of the garrison. Any temporary interference
with the aqueduct would in this case be productive
of no inconvenience. The existence of a water-course on the
enemy’s side of the Wall at <span class='sc'>Hunnum</span>, which may have served
a similar purpose, has already been noticed. At <span class='sc'>Bremenium</span>,
High Rochester, some guttered stones, covered with flags,
were recently found lying in a direction which led to the supposition,
that they brought water from some springs outside
the station to the eastern moat.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the Archæologia Æliana<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c012'><sup>[117]</sup></a> is a plan and description of
an ancient aqueduct, which brought water from some distant
rivulets to the station at Lanchester. It consists of two
branches, the longer of which is nearly four miles in extent.
Earthen embankments, to preserve the level, are occasionally
used in both of them, and, as they run over sandy ground,
the bottom of them has been puddled. The two lines, after
uniting, deliver their water into a reservoir outside the station,
near to its south-west corner. That the water of this aqueduct
cannot have been used for domestic purposes appears
from what Hodgson, the author of the paper, adds—‘Several
wells have, from time to time, been discovered here by labourers,
on the outside of the walls, and there is a plentiful
spring at a short distance from where the bath stood.’</p>

<p class='c014'>Whatever may have been the object served, the water-course
at <span class='sc'>Æsica</span> is a striking memorial of the skill, forethought,
and industry of the Roman garrisons. At the present
day, in a highly civilized country, and after the enjoyment
of a long period of internal peace, we are but beginning
to see the necessity of bringing water from a distance into
our large towns. An individual garrison, exposed to all the
hazards of war, scrupled not, even fourteen or sixteen centuries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>ago, for some purpose which they thought important,
to cut a water-course six miles long!</p>

<p class='c014'>It is not a little remarkable too, that after the lapse of so
long a period, the cutting should be distinctly visible through
so large a portion of its track.</p>

<p class='c014'>The view which is here taken of the object of the water-course
is not given because it is absolutely satisfactory, but
because it presents the fewest difficulties. We might have
expected that if a miniature lake had been formed on the
north of the station, some remains of the embankment necessary
to confine its waters would appear; none are, however,
to be observed. The soil, on being turned up, has not the
black and sludgy aspect, which might be anticipated, but is
of a yellow hue; the bottom of a pond at Wall-mill, which
was drained within living memory, has, however, a precisely
similar appearance.</p>

<p class='c000'>To the south of Great Chesters is Wall-mill, near
to which the burying ground of the station seems to
have been. Brand observed here several remarkable
barrows, and was shewn some of the graves
which had been opened. ‘They consisted,’ he tells
us, ‘of side stones set down into the earth, and
covered at top with other larger stones.’ He took
them to be very early Christian sepulchres; this is
more than doubtful. The progress of agricultural
improvement has obliterated all traces of the cemetery;
to one, however, of its sepulchral monuments
reference will afterwards be made.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Romans systematically avoided intra-mural
interments. The following is one of the laws of the
Twelve Tables:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">HOMINEM MORTUUM IN URBE NE SEPELITO NEVE URITO.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It is remarkable that at so early a period of the history
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>of the republic, attention should have been
turned to this subject, and that in a digest of legislation
so brief as that referred to, this should form
one of the enactments.</p>

<div class='sidenote c015'>COCK-MOUNT-HILL.</div>

<p class='c000'>Shortly after leaving <span class='sc'>Æsica</span>, the crags again appear,
and the Wall ascends the heights. At Cock-mount-hill,
about a quarter of a mile forward, the
Murus is four or five feet high. On the Ollalee
ground, it is six and seven feet high, and shews on
the north, nine courses of facing-stones; at another
place, ten courses appear, and the height is six feet
four inches.<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c012'><sup>[118]</sup></a> The earth-works are seen in the valley
below, covered with the whin, called by botanists,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Genista Anglica</em></span>. The continuous sandstone ridge is
deeply scarred with ancient quarries.<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c012'><sup>[119]</sup></a> Here the
view is most extensive, Skiddaw, Crossfell, and other
celebrated summits, shewing themselves conspicuously
on the south, and Burnswark, a peculiar flat-topped
eminence, and several more distant hills, on
the north. A truncated pyramid of stones and earth,
used by the ordnance surveyors,<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c012'><sup>[120]</sup></a> has been left upon
the elevated ridge, called Mucklebank-crag.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>WALLTOWN-CRAGS.</div>

<p class='c000'>The next defile that we reach is a very wide one,
and is denominated Walltown crags. Walltown
consists of a single house, which, though now occupied
by the tenant of the farm, bears marks of having
formerly been a place of strength, and the
residence of persons of consideration. Ridley the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>Martyr refers with much affection in his valedictory
letter to his brother who resided here:—</p>

<p class='c014'>Farewell, my dearly beloved brother John Ridley of the
Waltoune, and you my gentle and loving sister, Elizabeth,
whom, besides the natural league of amity, your tender love,
which you were said ever to bear towards me above the rest
of your brethren, doth bind me to love. My mind was to
have acknowledged this your loving affection, and to have requited
it with deeds, and not with words alone. Your
daughter Elizabeth I bid farewell, whom I love for the meek
and gentle spirit that God hath given her, which is a precious
thing in the sight of God.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the crevices of the whin rock, near the house,
chives grow abundantly. The general opinion of
the country is, that they are the produce of plants
cultivated by the Romans, who were much addicted
to the use of this and kindred vegetables. This belief
is but a modification of the more extended
statements of our earliest writers on the Wall.
Sampson Erdeswicke in 1574, says—</p>

<p class='c014'>The Skotts lyches, or surgeons, do yerely repayr to the
sayd Roman Wall next to thes, (Caer Vurron) to gether
sundry herbs for surgery, for that it is thought that the
Romaynes there by had planted most nedefull herbes for
sundry purposes, but howsoever it was, these herbes are fownd
very wholesome.</p>

<p class='c000'>Camden gives an account precisely similar.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the eastern declivity of the gap, and near the
line of the Wall, is a well, which, in the district, is
generally called king Arthur’s Well. Brand, however,
gives a different account of it:—</p>

<p class='c014'>At Walltown, I saw the well wherein Paulinus is said to
have baptized king Ecfrid. It has evidently been enclosed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>which indicates something remarkable in so open and wild a
country. Some wrought stones lay near it. The water is
very cool and fine.</p>

<p class='c000'>The western ascent is steep. Hutton tells us he was
sometimes obliged to crawl on all fours. On the
summit are evident traces of a mile-castle.</p>

<div id='p265'  class='figcenter id018'>
<img src='images/i_p265.jpg' alt='Nine-nicks of Thirlwall' class='ig001' />
</div>

<div class='sidenote'>NINE-NICKS OF THIRLWALL.</div>

<p class='c000'>We now enter upon a most interesting part of the
line. The mural ridge, divided by frequent breaks
into as many isolated crags, is denominated the
Nine Nicks of Thirlwall. The view from the edge
of the cliff is extensive; stunted trees unite with the
craggy character of the rock in giving variety to the
foreground. The Wall adheres, with tolerable pertinacity,
to the edge of the crags, and hence pursues
a course that is by no means direct. The accompanying
wood-cut, which exhibits the view looking
eastwards, shews the zig-zag path which it adopts.
Nearly all our historians agree in stating that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>most perfect specimens of the Wall now remaining,
are on Walltown crags. Certain it is that all who
have examined the other parts of the Wall with care,
will visit this with peculiar pleasure; but such are the
varied features which each section of the Barrier
presents, and the consequent interest which each
excites, that it is difficult to determine which part,
on the whole, is most worthy of attention.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>WALLTOWN-CRAGS.</div>

<p class='c000'>For a considerable distance along the crags, the
Wall is in excellent preservation, presenting, on the
north side, in several places, ten courses of facing-stones,
and in one, twelve. In the highest part it is
eight feet nine inches high, and nine feet thick. The
military way may in many places be seen, avoiding
very dexterously the more abrupt declivities of its
rocky path.</p>

<p class='c000'>At length the cliffs, which extend in a nearly unbroken
series from Sewingshields to Carvoran, sink
into a plain, and the fertility and the beauty of a
well-cultivated country re-appear.</p>

<p class='c000'>However pleasing the change, the traveller will
not fail occasionally to look back upon the road he
has trod, and view with secret satisfaction those bold
and airy heights which so well symbolize the austere
and undaunted spirit of that great people whose works
he is contemplating; and when in after years, and it
may be in some region far distant, the image of them
rises in his imagination, he will be ready to exclaim—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c005'>

      <div class='line'>I feel the gales that from ye blow</div>
      <div class='line'>A momentary bliss bestow.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='sidenote c015'>CARVORAN.</div>
<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>MAGNA, the modern Carvoran, lies to the south
both of the Vallum and Wall. The nature of the
ground in its neighbourhood seems to have dictated
this arrangement. The Wall occupies the edge of
a strip of elevated ground, the benefit of which, as a
position of strength against an enemy, it was desirable
not to lose. Had the station been placed as usual
on the line of the Wall, the Vallum, in skirting its
southern rampart, would have been brought into a
swamp that occupies the valley between the high
ground on which the Wall stands, and the somewhat
commanding site of the station. Both the lines of the
Barrier have therefore been allowed to pursue their
parallel course nearly together, and the station has
been placed about two hundred and fifty yards within
the Wall, on a platform which is sufficiently defended
on the south by the declivity that slopes from it
to the modern village of Greenhead.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is not impossible, however, that <span class='sc'>Magna</span> may
have been one of Agricola’s forts, the valley, through
which the river Tipalt flows, requiring the adoption
of this method of resisting the aggressions of the
Caledonians.</p>

<p class='c000'>The station has enclosed an area of four acres and
a half. Having, a few years ago, been brought under
tillage, it is with difficulty that even its outline can
now be traced; some fragments of the north rampart,
however, remain, and the north fosse is distinct.<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c012'><sup>[121]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>MAGNA.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>In the front of the farm-house which was erected
in the year—long to be remembered in these parts—1745,
is built up a Roman altar, apparently without
an inscription. In the garden, and behind the dwelling,
are several other interesting memorials of Roman
occupation. Amongst them are broken capitals
and fragments of columns, moulded coping-stones,
gutter-stones, and troughs, of various shapes and
rude construction. Several bases of columns lie
scattered about, the prevailing form of which is
square, as shewn in <a href='#p224f'>Plate XIII</a>., fig. 5; one of them
is, however, of circular shape, and is ornamented with
a cable-pattern moulding, resembling the Housesteads
pedestal, given in <a href='#p224b'>Plate XI</a>.<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c012'><sup>[122]</sup></a> There are also
preserved here a small altar, in perfect preservation,
inscribed, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='fss'>D[E]O BE[L]ATVCADRO</span></span>, some imperfect
altars, several centurial stones, a broken effigy
of the bird of Jove, a pair of bronze shears (figured
of the full size on <a href='#p268a'>Plate XIV</a>., fig. 1), evidently,
from their proportions, meant to be handled
by fair fingers, fragments of Samian ware and amphoræ,
a few beads, and some implements of iron.
Amongst the articles disinterred from the stations on
the line, there are generally to be found numerous
small flat circular implements, of which examples
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>are engraved (of the full size) on <a href='#p224b'>Plate XI</a>. They
vary from half-an-inch to two inches in diameter,
and have a circular hole in the centre. For the
most part they are composed of sherds of Samian
ware, occasionally, of jet, and of amber; at Carvoran
are some of rude shape, made of imperfectly
burnt clay and shale. Various conjectures have been
hazarded respecting their use; the most probable is,
that they were employed as tallies, the small beads
representing units, the large, tens. In the inn at
Glenwhelt are preserved a magnificent pair of stag’s
horns, nearly perfect, which were found in the well
of the station; each antler is a yard long. In the
possession of the Society of Antiquaries, Newcastle-upon-Tyne,
are several valuable inscribed stones
derived from this station, which have been presented
by Colonel Coulson of Blenkinsop Hall.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Magna</span>, during the days of Roman occupation,
must have been a place of considerable importance.
Not only did the road which leads directly from
<span class='sc'>Cilurnum</span>, come up to it, but the Maiden-way, from
Whitley Castle and the south, ran through it, as is
supposed, to Bewcastle and the other stations north
of the Wall, as shewn on the Map, <a href='#if26'>Plate I</a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rejoining the lines of the Barrier, we find them
about to descend into the valley watered by the
Tipalt, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>insaniens flumen</em></span>, as Camden calls it. The
moat of the Wall is peculiarly well developed,
that of the Vallum, though less so, is still
distinct; they are exactly parallel to each other.
Before the traveller forsakes his present elevation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>it will be well for him to mark the westward
course of the objects of his study, lest he lose
their track in the swampy ground fronting Thirlwall
Castle. A valley of considerable extent stretches
before him; on the north brow of it, at the distance
of about three miles, Gilsland Spa is situated; the
works of the Barrier stand upon its southern edge.
The trough of the north fosse may easily be discerned
where it is intersected by the railway.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has been suggested that one of the objects
contemplated by the Romans in the construction
of a double line of fortification, was the enclosure
of a space of ground which might be cultivated by
the garrison, and where their cattle might graze in
security. If this had been the case, the Wall would
have been drawn along the northern margin of the
wide and fruitful valley of Gilsland, and the Vallum
along its southern edge.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THIRLWALL CASTLE.</div>

<p class='c000'>Thirlwall Castle is, as Hutchinson calls it, ‘a dark,
melancholy fortress’ of the middle age.<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c012'><sup>[123]</sup></a> It was
for many centuries previous to its purchase by
the ancestors of the earl of Carlisle, the residence
of an ancient Northumbrian family of the name
of Thirlwall. Amongst the witnesses examined
on the occasion of the famous suit between the
families of Scrope and Grosvenor, for the right
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>to bear the shield ‘azure, a bend or,’ which was
opened at Newcastle-upon-Tyne in 1385, before
king Richard II. in person, was John Thirlwall, an
esquire of Northumberland. The witness related
what he had heard on the subject of the dispute, from
his father, who ‘died at the age of 145, and was when
he died the oldest esquire in all the North, and had
been in arms in his time sixty-nine years.’ Such is
the language of the record of these proceedings, preserved
in the Tower of London.</p>

<p class='c000'>This locality may also bring to the reader’s remembrance

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It is not generally known that this ‘ancient ditty,’
which sir Walter Scott gives at length in a note as a
genuine antique, is a modern fabrication, the production
of his correspondent Surtees, the historian of
Durham. The ballad, however, breathes the very
spirit of the fierce borderers, or it would not have
deceived so accomplished an antiquary as Scott.</p>

<p class='c000'>The walls of the castle are nine feet thick, and
are faced, both inside and outside, with stones taken
from the Roman Wall. It is a singular thing to
see a building, formed out of a prior structure, itself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>in ruins, and becoming a prey to yet more modern
depredators. The stones remain meanwhile, whether
in the primeval structure, or in those of mediæval
and recent date, as good as ever. Brand observes—</p>

<p class='c014'>There is built up near the inn at Glenwhelt, a most barbarous,
gigantic head of stone, which is most certainly not
Roman. It came from Thirlwall Castle, and has no doubt
belonged to some of those hideous figures made use of anciently
in such castles to frighten the distant enemy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Brand’s original still graces the
vicinity of the inn, and its
effigy, this page. Its ugliness
is no proof that it is not Roman;
but, after all, whose beauty
would not be tarnished by exposure
such as it has endured?</p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>CENTRAL REGION OF THE BARRIER.</div>

<p class='c000'>That portion of the line which lies between the
Tipalt and the Irthing is probably weaker than any
other between Wallsend and Bowness. Not only
is the ground flat, but it is destitute of the aid which
copious rivers give it, both at its eastern and western
extremities. Throughout the whole of this district,
both barriers keep close together. Except in the
neighbourhood of Rose-hill, no portion of the stone
Wall remains in all this tract.</p>

<p class='c000'>The country between the Tipalt and the Solway
is characterized by a number of diluvial hills, not
unfrequently resembling barrows. To the south of
Brampton, they are so numerous and so nearly uniform
in size and shape as to suggest to the playful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>imagination the idea of their being gigantic mole-hills.
The occurrence of these in the line of the
Barrier must have caused some trouble to the engineer
of the Wall. The difficulty, however, was
overcome. The first hill of this description
that we meet with, occurs immediately westward of
the point where the Newcastle and Carlisle railroad
crosses the mural line. The Wall unhesitatingly
ascends it on the one side, and descends it on the
other, though it would scarcely have described a
larger arc had it gone round its base.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>VALLUM AT WALLEND.</div>

<p class='c000'>About half-a-mile onward is a small village, called
Wallend. The earth-works are, for a short distance,
in an admirable state of preservation; nowhere
else is the Vallum seen to greater advantage.</p>

<p class='c000'>A peculiarity in the relative position of the Wall
and Vallum will here force itself upon the attention.
The Wall, which, for the larger portion of its course,
stands considerably above the Vallum, now takes a
lower level, and for nearly the whole space between
this point and the Irthing, is completely commanded
by the earthen ramparts. The following diagram will
give a general idea of the country, and of the mutual
relation between the two structures. Had the
Wall (A) and Vallum (B) been independent undertakings,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>this arrangement would not have been adopted.
The earth-works ascribed to Hadrian having been
found inefficient, would have been relentlessly cut in
upon by the officers of Severus, who would doubtless
have planted the Wall in those positions which were
naturally the strongest, irrespective of any prior
work. As it is, to give the Vallum the advantage
of an eminence in resisting a southern foe, the Wall
relinquishes a portion of the acclivity which it might
with advantage have taken.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>CHAPEL HOUSE.</div>

<p class='c000'>Chapel-house and Fowl-town, two contiguous
farm-houses, are next met with in our course.
Chapel-house is probably the site of a mile-castle,
it having been constructed out of the materials of a
<span id='p274' class='figleft id013'><img src='images/i_p274.jpg' alt='Slab to Hadrian, by Leg. XX. V. V.' class='ig001' /></span>prior building, which boasted walls of great thickness.
An inscribed stone,

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>At the village of Gap, the Vallum, which is very
distinct, stands considerably above the Wall. The
place is said to take its name from the Wall having
been broken through here at an early period.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rose-hill is a hill no longer. The top of the
diluvial mount was thrown into the surrounding
hollow, in order to afford a site for the railway station,
that has assumed the name of the summit
which it displaced.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>MUMP’S HALL.</div>

<p class='c000'>In the immediate neighbourhood of Rose-hill is
Mump’s-hall, formerly the residence of the Meg
Merrilies of sir Walter Scott:—</p>

<p class='c014'>'Mump’s-hall,' says Hodgson, 'according to tradition, was
once a public-house, kept by a notorious person of the name
of Meg Teasdale, who drugged to death such of her guests as
had money. In Guy Mannering she glares in the horrid
character of Meg Merrilies. But certainly all this tradition
is deeply coloured with unpardonable slander against the ancient
and respectable family of the Teasdales of Mump’s-hall.'</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir Walter Scott was in early life an occasional resident at
Gilsland. The broad, flat stone is pointed out, a little above
the Shaws Hotel, on which tradition asserts he was standing
when he declared to the subsequent lady Scott the emotions
which agitated his bosom. He had therefore the opportunity
of becoming acquainted with the district and its traditions.</p>

<p class='c014'>The small thatched cottage, opposite to the road leading
from the railway station, is usually pointed out as the residence
of Meg, but it is not the one which was occupied by her. She
lived in the larger building beyond, round which the road bends
at a right angle. The front of the house is modernized, but the
back of it still retains the character of a border fortress. My
information upon this and other subjects respecting her, has
been derived from an individual residing in the district, whose
mother knew Meg well, and visited her upon her death-bed.
Although the heroine of Mump’s-hall was cast in a mould
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>somewhat suited to the state of the district at that time, she
was not the fiend-like woman that she is generally represented.
One murder, however, the tradition of the country lays to
her charge. A pedlar having called upon Meg’s brother,
who kept a school at Long Byers (mid-way between Rose-hill
and Greenhead), accidentally presented to him a box filled
with guineas instead of his snuff-box. The traveller was requested
to convey a note to Mump’s-hall, which he did, but
was not seen alive afterwards. Suspicion arising, the house
was searched, and the body found concealed among hay in
the barn; but the parties who made the discovery durst not
reveal it, for fear of injury to themselves and families. About
six weeks afterwards the body was found lying upon the
moors. My informant added to his narrative—‘probably
the laws were not so active in those days as at present, for
these things could not escape now.’</p>

<p class='c014'>When Meg was upon her death-bed, the curiosity of the
neighbourhood was excited, and many of her cronies visited
her, in hopes of hearing her disburthen her conscience respecting
the death of the pedlar. They were, however, disappointed;
for whenever she attempted to speak upon the subject,
some one of the family, who always took care to be present,
placed a hand upon her mouth.</p>

<p class='c014'>Upper Denton church is hard by. It is evidently a very
ancient building, and possibly exhibits some Saxon work. It
is one of the smallest churches in England, and is as damp
and mouldy as felons’ dungeons used to be. Meg and several
of the members of her family lie in the church-yard. Four
tombstones, ranged in a row, mark their resting places.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>POLTROSS-BURN.</div>

<p class='c000'>The works of the Barrier are crossed by the railway
a little to the west of Rose-hill station. The Wall
here exhibits three or four courses of facing-stones.
A little beyond this point, the lines, still clearly defined,
cross the stream called Poltross-burn, which divides
the counties of Northumberland and Cumberland.
The gorge in which the stream flows is deep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>and well-wooded. There are no remains of a bridge
in the valley, but traces of a mile-castle, by
which the defile has been guarded, are distinct upon
its western bank. Before reaching the Irthing, at a
farm-house called Willowford, the site of another
castellum may be discerned. From this point to the
water’s edge, the Wall and Vallum have probably
gone in close companionship; but this is a matter
which cannot now be ascertained. The western bank
of the river is lofty and precipitous. Consisting, as
it does, chiefly of diluvial soil and gravel, on which
the water of the stream below is continually acting,
it is not surprising that all traces of the Wall,
if it ever ascended the height, have long since disappeared.
On the very brink of the precipice above,
the remains of the Wall and fosse re-appear. The
faithful followers of the Wall, who have closely
pursued its track from the eastern sea, will not be
willing to desert their companion, even for a brief
space, at this point. The cliff, however, will test
their constancy. Hutton had his troubles; he says,
somewhat magniloquently—</p>

<div class='sidenote'>PASSAGE OF THE IRTHING.</div>

<p class='c014'>I had this river to cross, and this mountain to ascend, but
I did not know how to perform either. I effected a passage
over the river by the assistance of stones as large as myself,
sometimes in and sometimes out; but, with difficulty, reached
the summit of the precipice by a zig-zag line, through the
brambles, with a few scratches.</p>

<p class='c000'>The latest historian of the Wall attempted to ascend
the bank in a right line; he has given us the
result of his experience, as a warning to others.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>None of the party completely succeeded in ascending the
precipitous bank by the course of the Wall. The attempt is
very dangerous, and, as success accomplishes nothing, should
never be tried by those whose life and existence are in any
way useful.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the top of the cliff is a mile-castle. To the
north, two conical summits appear, which strongly
resemble barrows. We now approach Birdoswald,
the twelfth station on the line.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>AMBOGLANNA.</div>

day, is an interesting station.</p>

<p class='c000'>Numerous inscriptions have been
found within its walls, mentioning
the first cohort of the Dacians,
surnamed the Ælian, which,
according to the Notitia, was
quartered at <span class='sc'>Amboglanna</span>. One
of them, in the possession of
Robert Bell, esq., of the Nook,

</div>

<p class='c000'>The name <span class='sc'>Amboglanna</span> seems to signify, the
circling glen. The former part of the word, meaning
<em>about</em>, is met with in most of the western languages;
as the Welsh <i>am</i>, the Irish and Gaelic <i>umain</i>, the
Saxon <i>ymb</i> or <i>embe</i>, the Greek αμφι, and the Latin
(in compound words) <i>amb</i>. <i>Glanna</i> is obviously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>synonymous with the modern <em>glen</em>, a term of very
frequent use in the land of the Gäel.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here the name has been most appropriately bestowed.
The camp stands upon the precipitous edge
of a tongue of land, which, on every side except the west,
is severed from the adjoining ground by deep scars.
Hodgson describes the spot with great accuracy—</p>

<p class='c014'>The Irthing, in front of the station, makes two grand and
sweeping turns, under red scars, which have rich flat grounds
before them, deeply fringed along the margin of the river
with a border of alder, heckberry (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Prunus Padus</em></span>, or bird-cherry,)
and other upland trees. When the banks are not
steep, they are deeply wooded: and diluvial hills, rounded
into vast and beautiful varieties of form, present to the eye
rich sylvan and cultivated scenes, while their component parts,
as the river passes their sides, expose to the geologist rounded
specimens of the different kinds of rocks to be found in the
plains of Cumberland, and the high mountains that lie on
each side of the Firth of the Solway.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>BIRDOSWALD.</div>

<p class='c000'>The modern name presents greater difficulties
than the ancient one. Had king Oswald been a
denizen of these parts, which he was not, we might
have supposed that Birdoswald was a <em>burgh</em> of his.
The name is one of old standing, but the etymology
of it can only be a subject of conjecture.<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c012'><sup>[124]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The station contains an area of between five and
six acres. The walls are in an unusually good state
of preservation; the southern rampart shewing
eight courses of facing-stones. Camden’s statement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>is still true to the letter;—‘it has been surrounded
with a stately wall of free-stone, about five feet thick,
as may be fairly measured at this day.’ The moat
which surrounded the wall may also be satisfactorily
traced.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although the Wall adapts itself to the north rampart
of the fort, the station is entirely independent
of the Wall (see the wood-cut <em>p.</em> <a href='#p084'>84</a>), and must
have been built before it. Probably the first step
taken in the construction of the Barrier, in every
case, was the erection of the stationary camps.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Vallum cannot now be traced in the immediate
vicinity of the station; but Gordon tells us, that
it came close up to the southern rampart.</p>

<div id='p280'  class='figleft id015'>
<img src='images/i_p280.jpg' alt='West Gateway, Birdoswald, Amboglanna' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>The southern gateway may be discerned, though
it is encumbered
with rubbish;
the eastern and
western have recently
been divested
of much
of the matter that
has for ages obscured
them. The
wood-cut, representing
the western
portal, as seen
from the inside,
exhibits the pivot-holes of the gates, and the ruts
worn by the chariots or wagons of the Romans.
The ruts are nearly four feet two inches apart,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>the precise gauge of the chariot marks in the
east gateway at Housesteads. The more perfect
of the pivot-holes exhibits a sort of spiral grooving,
which seems to have been formed with a
view of rendering the gate self-closing. The aperture
in the sill of the doorway, near the lower
jamb, has been made designedly, as a similar vacuity
occurs in the eastern portal; perhaps the object of
it has been to allow of the passage of the surface
water from the station.</p>

<p class='c000'>The whole area of the camp is marked with the
lines of streets and the ruins of buildings. The
present farm-house occupies, according to Horsley,
the site of the pretorium. On the east side of the
southern gateway are the remains of a kiln for
drying corn; the stones are reddened by fire. Near
the eastern gateway a building, furnished with a
hypocaust, has been partially excavated. From its
ruins a sculptured figure, draped, and in a sitting
posture, has recently been taken. The head and
other highly relieved parts were found to have been
broken off: it remains on the ground.</p>

<div id='p281'  class='figright id013'>
<img src='images/i_p281.jpg' alt='Mural Stone, Leg. VI. V. F.' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>A large altar with an inscription, which is in a
great measure illegible, lies within the walls of the
camp. A stone broken
in two pieces, and which
is preserved on the spot,
bears testimony to the
presence of the sixth
legion here; it may be read, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='fss'>LEGIO SEXTA VICTRIX
FIDELIS</span></span>—The Sixth legion the Victorious and Faithful.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>AMBOGLANNA.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>The boldness of the lettering, and the depth and
clearness of the cutting, give reason to suppose that
the inscription is of early date. Besides these, several
centurial stones, mill-stones, and coping-stones, as
well as portions of tile, and fragments of pottery, are
preserved in the farm-house, and yield to the visitor
indubitable proofs of Roman occupation. In draining
the field to the west of the station, many small
altars, without inscriptions, have been found, which
were remorselessly broken, and used with other materials
for filling the drains. Strange, that altars
before which Romans of ‘fierce countenance’ have
bowed, should be put to such a use!</p>

<p class='c000'>Westward of Birdoswald, the Wall is in an unusually
good state of preservation. Taking into
account, not only the height, but the length of the
fragment, and the completeness of the facing-stones
on both sides, it may be pronounced the finest specimen
of the great structure that now remains.
Some portions of it, however, are beginning to exhibit
evident signs of decrepitude and decay.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>
<img src='images/i_p283.jpg' alt='Section of Works, Wallbours' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Within a short mile of the station, the remains of
a castellum appear. Here the Vallum exhibits the
unusual feature of a second ditch, as is represented
in the subjoined section.<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c012'><sup>[125]</sup></a> Hodgson says—</p>

<p class='c014'>Through a bog, about a mile west of <span class='sc'>Amboglanna</span>, the
Vallum has had two ditches, probably intended for draining
the military road that ran between them. They are still very
distinct.</p>

<p class='c000'>A careful examination of the spot induces me to
think, that the additional fortification was intended
to give increased security to a defile, which, running
from the vicinity of the Wall to the bed of the Irthing
below, renders the works in this part more than
usually liable to attack from the south.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE WORKS AT WALLBOURS.</div>

<p class='c000'>At the western extremity of this extra ditch,
the Wall and Vallum come into close proximity;
the space between them was, with the exception of
room for the military way, occupied by the foundations
of a castellum. The place bears the name of
Wallbours.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Barrier next crosses a small hill called the Pike.
The Vallum is a little below the summit of the eminence,
on its southern side; if this fortification had
been formed irrespective of the Wall, it would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>doubtless have been drawn along the top of the
height. The same remark applies to Hare-hill.</p>

<p class='c000'>The view from the Pike, of the flat and fertile
vale below is truly magnificent.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE WALL AT HARE-HILL.</div>

<p class='c000'>Soon after passing Banks-burn, we arrive at
Hare-hill, where a portion of the Wall stands nine
feet ten inches in height. This is the highest piece
of the Wall that is anywhere to be met with; but,
owing to the smallness of the fragment, and to its
being entirely deprived of facing-stones, it is less
imposing than it would otherwise be. Hutton’s enthusiasm,
however, never fails him; his remark at
Hare-hill is—</p>

<p class='c014'>I viewed this relick with admiration: I saw no part higher.</p>

<p class='c000'>At this point of our progress, the antiquary may
be disposed to turn aside for a little, to view two
relics of the mediæval period of great interest—Lanercost
Priory and Naworth Castle. The priory
is a beautiful specimen of the early English style,
and bears architectural evidence of having been
built somewhere between the years 1155 and 1160.
Besides the church, partially in ruins and partially
in repair, the refectory and some portions of the monastic
buildings remain. The whole structure has
been formed of stones taken from the Roman Wall.
In addition to some altars preserved in the crypt of
the church, several centurial and carved stones are
to be seen in the walls of the adjacent buildings.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>NAWORTH CASTLE.</div>

<p class='c000'>Naworth Castle, though still an interesting building,
is destitute of some of the attractions which it once
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>possessed. The Roman altars and other primeval
monuments collected by lord William Howard, have
long been dispersed, and a fire in 1844, almost entirely
destroyed the baronial residence of that renowned
border-chief, which, until that event, remained
nearly in the state in which it was in his own day.
The dungeons, however, in which the daring moss-troopers
were immured, remain, and two magnificent
oak trees near the grand entrance still extend
those brawny arms on which, according to tradition,
lord William suspended the victims of his lawless
power. The load of twenty gasping wretches would
not materially weigh down the larger boughs of these
fine trees. That the government of lord William—the
Belted Will of Border tales—was of a vigorous
character, there cannot be a doubt; but that he used
his power capriciously, cruelly, or tyrannically, there
is no evidence. Lord William seems to have sent
the most desperate of his prisoners to Newcastle-upon-Tyne
or Carlisle. They would probably have
as good a chance for life at Belted Will’s tribunal
as at the assizes of either of these towns, if we
may judge of the state of feeling towards them from
North’s Life of Lord-keeper Guildford. His lordship,
then sir Francis North, came to Newcastle, on
the northern circuit, in 1676. His biographer says—</p>

<p class='c014'>The country is yet very sharp upon thieves; and a violent
suspicion, there, is next to conviction. When his lordship
held the assizes at Newcastle, there was one Mungo Noble,
supposed to be a great thief, brought to trial before his lordship,
upon four several indictments; and his lordship was so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>much a south-country judge as not to think any of them well
proved. One was for stealing a horse of a person unknown,
and the evidence amounted to no more than that a horse was
seen feeding upon the heath near his shiel, and none could
tell who was the owner of it. In short the man escaped,
much to the regret of divers gentlemen, who <em>thought he
deserved</em> to be hanged, and that was enough. While the
judge at the trial discoursed of the evidence and its defects,
a Scotch gentleman upon the bench, who was a border commissioner,
made a long neck towards the judge and said—'My
laird, send him to huzz, and ye’s ne'er see him mair.'</p>

<p class='c000'>On rejoining the Barrier, we find, that though
the line of the Wall, in its course to the Eden,
may yet be distinctly discerned, in very few instances
any portion of the masonry remains.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>MONEY-HOLES.</div>

<p class='c000'>The site of a mile-castle nearly opposite Lanercost
Priory, is termed Money-holes, in consequence
of the efforts made to discover some treasure supposed
to be concealed in it. At Crag-hill the
north ditch is very bold. At Hayton-gate, a drove
road, probably an ancient pass, crosses the line of
the Wall from north to south. At Randilands the
north fosse is still well developed. After crossing
the rivulet, called Burtholme-beck, a piece of the
Wall is seen, which stands about seven feet high;
its facing-stones are gone, but the rough pebbly mortar
possesses its original tenacity. As is often the
case, the ruin is tufted with hazel bushes and stunted
specimens of the alder and oak. The Vallum is
about seventy yards to the south of the Wall.</p>

<p class='c000'>Approaching Low-wall,<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c012'><sup>[126]</sup></a> something like an out-work
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>appears on the north side of the Barrier. Has
there been a double line of wall here? After crossing
a road, denominated Friar-wain-gate, which
leads from Bewcastle to Lanercost, we reach another
house called Wall; Roman masons might claim
many of the stones as theirs. At How-gill is a cottage,
where probably a mile-castle stood to defend
the ‘beck,’ In the modern structure may be observed
stones broached in the Roman fashion, and
others variously tooled by Roman hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>The farm-house of Dove-cote is on the eastern
bank of the King-water. The fosse and the foundation
of the Murus are seen crossing the hill on the
northern side of the summit: the Vallum, which is
indistinctly marked, probably took a corresponding
position on the southern side.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>WALTON.</div>

<p class='c000'>The village of Walton, by its very name, bears
testimony to its relationship with the great Barrier-line.
Many of the stones of the Wall may be detected
in its cottages. One of its dwellings furnishes
a good specimen of the mode of cottage-building
formerly prevalent in the North. The rafters of the
house, which consist of large and rudely-shaped
pieces of timber, instead of resting upon the walls,
come down to the ground; they are tied together
near the top by a transverse beam, and the mud
walls, as well as the thatched roof, partially depend
upon them for support. Horsley says, 'at Wal-town
there seems to have been some fortification or
encampment. One side of the square is yet very
visible, and the ramparts pretty large, about eighty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>yards long. It is high ground and dry. Perhaps it
has been a summer encampment or exploratory post
for the garrison at Cambeck.'</p>

<p class='c000'>At Sandysike farm-house the foundation of the
Wall as well as abundant traces of mural vicinage
are to be seen. The barn consists of Roman stones
marked with the diamond-broaching. Several
sculptured stones are built up in the garden-wall;
amongst them is one which displays the thunderbolt
of Jove; the wall-fruit peacefully rests upon
it. Another, exhibiting the wheel of Nemesis, the
emblem of swift justice, and which no doubt once
formed part of an altar to Jupiter, is built into a pig-sty.
A mill-stone of peculiar shape, and closely resembling
one at Naworth Castle, is preserved on the
grounds; it is probably Roman.</p>

<div class='sidenote c015'>PETRIANA.</div>

<p class='c000'>PETRIANA, the Cambeck-fort of Horsley, and
the Castle-steads of the locality, is to the south of the
Vallum and Wall. A deep scar separates it from
the lines of the Barrier. The site of the station
may be recognised, but it is long since its ramparts
were overthrown, and the ruined buildings of the
interior entirely obliterated.</p>

<p class='c000'>Its rich soil and sunny exposure recommended it
to the father of the present proprietor of Walton-house
as a fitting site for a garden, and such it is at
the present day. It has yielded many altars and<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>CAMBECK-FORT.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
sculptured stones, some of which are still preserved
upon the spot, and from time to time the spade still
reveals to the numismatist, treasures, over the loss of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>which, Romans in ancient days may have mourned,
though not in a degree proportioned to their present
value. Wood-cuts of three of the coins which have
been found at Castlesteads are here introduced, as
they commemorate the family of a man whose name
is intimately connected with the Wall. They are in
the cabinet of Robert Bell, esq., of Irthington.</p>

Syria whose destiny it was to marry a king, and accordingly
solicited and obtained in marriage Julia Domna.</p>

was invested with the dignity of Augustus. Amongst his
other titles, he bore the name of Britannicus, as is shewn
on the coin. The engraver of the die from which this coin was
struck, has probably given a correct likeness of his subject;
at least, he has represented an individual who appears capable
of attempting an aged father’s life, and of imbruing his hands
in the blood of a brother. Vengeance at length overtook him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Notitia places the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Ala Petriana,’</span> under a prefect,
at <span class='sc'>Petriana</span>. Although two inscriptions belonging
to this place mention the second cohort of
the Tungri, none have been found here which name
the Ala Petriana. It is possible that this cohort
may have been a part of the Ala Petriana, but until
this point be settled, or some further light thrown
upon the subject, the occurrence of Cambeck-fort<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>CAMBECK-FORT.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
next in order to <span class='sc'>Amboglanna</span>, must be regarded as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>best evidence of its being the <span class='sc'>Petriana</span> of the Notitia.</p>

<div id='p292'  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_p292.jpg' alt='View of Pigeon Crag' class='ig001' />
</div>

<div class='sidenote'>WRITTEN-ROCK OF GELT.</div>

<p class='c000'>Before crossing the Cambeck-water it may be well
to remind the reader, that the river Gelt, on whose
rocky banks the Roman quarrymen have left lettered
memorials of their toil, is about four miles to the
south of this place. With the view of clearly displaying
the inscription, which has frequently been
inaccurately engraved, the lithograph opposite to page
81, has been drawn to a scale which precludes the
possibility of shewing the height of the cliff. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>adjoining wood-cut partly supplies this deficiency;
it exhibits another inscription, not of a very intelligible.<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>PIGEON-CRAG.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
character, on the Pigeon-crag, which is a
little higher up the water, and shews the general
character of the scenery on this beautiful stream.</p>

<p class='c000'>The distance of these quarries on the Gelt, from the
line of the Barrier, renders it very questionable
whether large supplies were derived from them for
the Wall. Hodgson remarks—</p>

<p class='c014'>The quarry at Helbeck-scar (the Written-rock) might serve
for the largest stones for part of the Murus, and the stations
at Brampton-old-church, and Walton-castlesteads; for the
general purpose of the Murus, stone, however, could be got in
places much nearer than Helbeck-scar.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the quarries of High and Low Breaks, about a
mile and a half north of the Wall, there are marks of
extensive ancient workings; the quarries are still in
use and yield stone of good quality.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Written-rock will not be easily found by a
stranger, but directions and assistance may generally
be obtained from the workmen employed upon a
modern quarry, which is not far from the spot.</p>

<div class='sidenote c015'>HEADSWOOD.</div>
<p class='c000'>We now rejoin the Barrier. The passage of the
Cambeck-water seems to have been guarded with
some care. On the eastern margin of the stream,
to the north of the Wall, is an earth-work raised a
little above the general level of the surface, which
here is somewhat depressed. Stones, which do not
appear in the contiguous parts, lie scattered about
the place. These circumstances seem to favour the
idea of there having been some additional fortification
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>in this part. The western bank of the stream
consists of a bold breastwork of red-sandstone, rising
about fifty feet above the level of the water. The
fosse of the Wall has been deeply cut into this rock;
it still remains in a state of great perfection. The
old drove-road between Newcastle and Carlisle,
which, for some distance west of this, runs upon the
site of the Wall, or close by it, here avails itself
of the fosse as a means of climbing the bank. The
ditch of the Vallum is also discernible. The farm-house
of Beck is partially constructed of Roman
stones, and on the east side of the rivulet of Beck
a few stones of the Wall are in their original situation.
Headswood, as its name implies, occupies a
commanding position. The ditch of the Vallum is
at this place peculiarly bold, and is about thirty-five
yards distant from the Wall. The fosse of the Wall
<span id='p294' class='figleft id013'><img src='images/i_p294.jpg' alt='Mural Stone, Leg. II. Aug.' class='ig001' /></span>bends round an object which has the appearance
of being an additional fortification outside the Wall.
At the west end of Newtown-of-Irthington are the
remains of a large mile-castle; the stones still lie in
confusion upon the site. The stone represented in
the margin was found at
this place. We next come
to White-flat, where the
rubble of the foundation of
the Wall is very discernible
and the ditch very deep. Hurtleton (the town
of strife) is next reached; both lines of fosse are distinct
and in close contiguity.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the corner of a field, called Chapel-field, there are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>evident signs of a mile-castle; the plough, however,
has been drawn over the site. The two works,
which between White-flat and this point have approached
each other very closely, now quickly diverge,
the Wall bending to the north.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>IRTHINGTON.</div>

<p class='c000'>The village of Irthington is a little to the south of
the Barrier. Here formerly stood one of the strongholds
of the powerful Norman family of De Vallibus;
the building is now entirely removed, its site being
occupied by the Nook, the residence of Robert Bell,
esq. The foundations of some of its walls have recently
been exposed. The keep probably occupied a
lofty earthen mound which is now crowned with
thriving trees. The parish church has recently
been renewed with much skill and taste. The old
fabric was entirely built of Roman wall-stones.
In the course of its restoration, a striking proof of
the disturbed state of the border district in the
middle ages was disclosed; a number of skeletons,
confusedly thrown together, being found buried within
its area. The church, originally a Transition-Norman
building, had evidently at some period after
its erection, been contracted in its dimensions by
the rejection of the side aisles. The outer walls
consisted of the original columns of the aisles, filled
up very roughly with common rubble. The columns
bore decided marks of fire. The neighbouring
parish church of Kirklinton, which has also been
recently rebuilt, exhibited similar appearances. On
taking down the old tower, which was a fortified
stronghold, the bony remnants of upwards of sixty
bodies were found in a space of not more than five
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>yards square; others were found in confused masses
in other parts. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>BORDER STRIFE.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The probable explanation of these circumstances
is this:—After the battle of Bannockburn,
the Scottish forces, flushed with success, entered
England, and the inhabitants, unable to withstand
them, fled to the churches for protection. But neither
the strength of the buildings nor their supposed
sanctity could yield them effectual succour; the
miserable people were slain, and their bodies
left among the smouldering ruins. Those of their
countrymen who escaped, buried them in a hasty
manner upon the spot. When the desolated district
had recovered energy enough to repair the
churches, its utmost efforts were barely sufficient
to enclose those parts which had, by their solidity,
withstood the fire; and the reduced population required
nothing more.</p>

<p class='c000'>The coins of Edw.I. and II. are comparatively abundant
in this district, the armies of that monarch and
his immediate successors, frequently taking the
western route, in their marches to and from Scotland.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rejoining the Wall, we meet, when within a quarter
of a mile of Old-wall, with the site of a mile-castle.
The ruins of the building slightly raise it
above the general level, and prevent the plough
biting into it. The road formerly deviated from its
track to go round it. An altar, an urn, and several
coins of Edward I., have been found in it. In the
buildings at Old-wall, many Roman stones will be
noticed, and the earth-works of both lines of the
Barrier may be traced. The Wall is entirely uprooted;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>upwards of six hundred cart-loads of stones,
within the recollection of the inhabitants, have been
taken from it in this immediate vicinity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Between this point and Stanwix, the works may
be traced with tolerable satisfaction, an ancient
drove-road running upon the site of the Wall for
the greater part of the way.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>BLEATARN.</div>

<p class='c000'>At Bleatarn (blue tarn or lake), on the south side
of the Wall, is a mound of earth resembling an
elongated barrow; between this earth-work and the
Wall, is a marshy hollow, which is said to have formerly
been the bed of a lake or tarn. The Vallum
takes a sweep to avoid this morass, and at its greatest
distance is removed from the Wall about two
hundred and twenty yards.</p>

<p class='c000'>About half-a-mile south from Bleatarn, is the site of
a Roman camp, which Horsley conceived to be one of
the stations <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>per lineam Valli</em></span>; it is now called Watch-cross.
If it be a station of this class, and if the order
in which the stations are arranged in the Notitia
exactly corresponds with their consecutive positions
in reality, the name of it was <span class='sc'>Aballaba</span>, which was
garrisoned by a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>numerus</em></span> or troop of Moors, under a
prefect. There is, however, reason to doubt whether
this was a stationary camp at all, as will presently
appear.</p>

<p class='c000'>As already remarked, no inscribed stones have
been found to identify any of the stations west of <span class='sc'>Amboglanna</span>
with the list given in the Notitia. Even
though this difficulty respecting Watch-cross had
not occurred, to go on appropriating the names of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>the Notitia, station after station, guided solely by
the slender thread of the order of their succession,
would be a hazardous undertaking, and is rendered
still more so by the uncertainty existing as to those
which are, and which are not, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>stationes per lineam
Valli</em></span>. In our journey from this point westward,
the stations will, therefore, be designated by their
modern names; when the Latin names are added, it
is to be understood that they are conjectural.</p>

<div class='sidenote c015'>WATCH-CROSS.</div>
<p class='c000'><em>WATCH-CROSS.</em>—Horsley gives the following
account of this station:—</p>

<p class='c014'>A little detached from the wall, to the south, is a Roman
fort, of about four chains and an half square, called Watch-cross;
and as I was assured by the country people, and have
had it since further confirmed, a military way has gone near it, or
between it and the military way belonging to the Wall; for
they often plough up paving stones here, and think part of the
highway to Brampton to be upon it. This is the least station
on the line of the Wall, and is as usual, plundered of its stones,
as that at Burgh and Drumburgh. However, the ramparts
and ditches are very fair and visible.</p>

<p class='c000'>The common on which it stood having been enclosed
about seventy years ago, and brought into
cultivation, all traces of the camp have been obliterated.
On a careful examination of its site, I failed
to discover any fragments of Roman pottery, or
other marks of Roman occupation. In those parts
of Cumberland where the soil is not naturally stony,
the site of a mile-castle or station, which has been
brought into cultivation, may often be distinguished
by the occurrence in that particular spot of numerous
fragments of freestone. No such appearance here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>presents itself. The person who farms the ground
says it is of better quality than the surrounding land;
still, it does not seem to possess the peculiar fertility
of a spot that has at any period for a length of time
been the resort of a crowded population. Hutchinson
describes ‘the whole ground-plot’ as being covered,
in his day, ‘with a low growth of heath;’ the sites
of all the other cities of the Wall are too replete with
animal remains to yield, even unaided by cultivation,
so coarse a product. I am therefore strongly disposed
to think, with Hodgson, that it was a mere summer
encampment. The spot has been well chosen;
for, though not greatly elevated, it has an extensive
prospect. Horsley himself had some doubts of
the propriety of admitting it into the rank of a stationary
camp, ‘by reason of its being so small,
and having no remains of stone walls.’ The distance,
however, between Cambeck-fort and Stanwix, which
is rather greater than that between any other two
stations, induced him to give it this position.</p>

<p class='c000'>From Bleatarn the antiquary will, with some care,
be able to trace the Barrier by Wall-head, Walby,
and Wall-foot, to Tarraby. From this village to
Stanwix, a rural road runs upon the foundations of
the Wall; the ditch on its north side, which within
living memory was very boldly marked, although
partially filled up is yet distinctly traceable.</p>

<div class='sidenote c015'>STANWIX.</div>
<p class='c000'><em>STANWIX.</em>—The church and church-yard of
Stanwix occupy the site of the station which guarded
the northern bank of the Eden. Recent explorations
have displayed distinct remains of ancient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>edifices. In pulling down the old church, to make
way for the present structure, a very fine figure of
Victory, somewhat mutilated, was disclosed, which is
now in the museum at Newcastle-upon-Tyne. The
name of the place indicates, that whilst the dwellings
in the vicinity were made of clay, as many of
them are yet, by reason of the plunder of the Roman
station, it could boast of being a <em>town of stones</em>.
The situation is one of great beauty. To the east, at
a considerable distance, the Nine-nicks of Thirlwall
rear their rugged peaks; and to the south and south-west,
appear the beautiful grounds of Rickerby-house,
the river Eden permeating a rich and well-cultivated
country, the ancient city of Carlisle crowned
with its venerable cathedral, and the long vista
of country terminating in the Cumbrian mountains.</p>

<p class='c004'>Between the station and the north bank of the
river Eden, the fosse of the Wall is distinctly
marked, and a hollowed line, formed by the excavation
of the foundation of the Wall itself, shews its
track to the water’s edge, near to the Hyssop-holme-well.
We are told by Camden—</p>

<p class='c014'>That the Wall passed the river over against the castle—where
in the very channel, the remains of it, namely, the great
stones, appear to this day.</p>

<p class='c000'>That the Wall, on the other side of the river,
clambered up that part of the castle-bank which projects
most boldly forward, is rendered probable by
the appearance of masonry, resembling its foundations,
beneath the grassy surface. At this point, however,
we lose all trace of the great structure until we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>get beyond the boundaries of the famous Border city
of the West.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>CARLISLE.</div>

<p class='c000'>All antiquaries agree that Carlisle is the <span class='sc'>Luguvallium</span>
of the Romans. It is not improbable that
it was one of Agricola’s forts. It is not named in
the list of the stations <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>per lineam Valli</em></span> given in the
Notitia. The Notitia mentions only the forts having
separate garrisons, and it is probable that after the
erection of the camp at Stanwix, <span class='sc'>Luguvallium</span> became
subordinate to that camp, and had no distinct
garrison, which will account for its omission.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whitaker says <span class='sc'>Luguvallium</span> signifies, in the ancient
Celtic, the fort upon the Waters.</p>

<p class='c000'>Extensive remains of the ancient city lie beneath
the modern Carlisle; seldom is the ground penetrated
to any considerable depth without disclosing
ancient masonry, Samian ware, and Roman coins.</p>

<p class='c000'>Carlisle contains two interesting structures of the
mediæval period—the castle and the cathedral. The
keep of the castle is a good specimen of the Norman
donjon, though some parts of it have been modernized.
On the walls and door of one of its chambers,
used as a prison in the ‘Fifteen’ and the ‘Forty-five,’
are to be seen the coats of arms, the devices, and marks
of the ‘sorrowful sighings,’ of the unhappy rebels, who
beguiled their wretched hours in carving them. The
cathedral exhibits some interesting specimens of the
Norman as well as later styles. Its east window,
which is of the decorated period, is the finest in the
kingdom, with the exception, perhaps, of the west
window at York.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>About a quarter of a mile beyond the canal basin,
and nearly midway between the canal and the river,
the track of the Wall may again be discerned. Owing
to the difficulty of entirely uprooting it, its foundations
have been suffered to remain; they form a cart-road
which is used for farm purposes. A little farther
on, the plough has won the day, and a uniform
green sward or luxuriant harvest baffles our research.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>KIRK-ANDREWS.</div>

<p class='c000'>A turf-covered mound on the east side of the
church of Kirk-andrews, is occasioned by a portion
of the ruins of the Wall. In the village is preserved
the altar of which the wood-cut gives a representation.
It was found at Kirk-steads, about a mile
south of the Wall, and bears marks of having been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>cut down to suit the purpose of some comparatively
modern builder. The focus of the altar is unusually
large; the boldness of the lettering indicates an
early date. It may be read—</p>

<p class='c000'>This is a vivid memorial of deeds of common occurrence

The original possessors of the isthmus, driven from
their homes, and forced to seek an asylum in the
hills to the north of the Wall, would be accounted
the lawful prey of the aggressor.</p>

his exploits on the votive stone, the routed remnants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>of the Caledonian bands would mourn over their
slaughtered comrades and desolated home-steads.</p>

<p class='c000'>The great scarcity of stone in the western part
of Cumberland has rendered the Wall a valuable
quarry to the inhabitants from time immemorial. In
our future progress we shall see little of it, except
in the buildings contiguous to its site. The heart
of the antiquary will, however, occasionally be gladdened
by the recognition of the lines of the earth-works—their
slightly elevated mounds appearing to
his eager gaze scarcely less beautiful than the moulded
forms produced by the genius of the sculptor,
in districts more rich than this, in the remains of
antiquity.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Vallum appears to have gone nearly due west,
along the valley, from Kirk-andrews to Burgh; the
Wall proceeds, after its usual manner, from eminence
to eminence.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>BURGH-UPON-SANDS.</div>
<p class='c000'><em>BURGH-UPON-SANDS</em> is the next station.
In Horsley’s day the remains of its ramparts were
to be seen at a place called the Old-castle, a little to
the east of the church. He says—</p>

<p class='c014'>On the west side these remains are most distinct, being
about six chains in length. And Severus’s Wall seems to
have formed the north rampart of the station. I was assured
by the person to whom the field belonged, that stones were
often ploughed up in it, and lime with the stones. Urns have
also frequently been found here. I saw, besides an imperfect
inscription, two Roman altars lying at a door in the town,
but neither sculptures nor inscriptions are now visible upon
them. ...... If besides all this, we consider the distance from
the last station at Stanwix, I think it can admit of no doubt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>but there must have been a station here, though most of its
ramparts are now levelled, the field having been in tillage
many years. I shall only further add, that it was very proper
to have a station at each end of the marsh, which, if the water
flowed as high as some believe, would make a kind of bay.</p>

<p class='c000'>At present, little meets the eye of the inquirer, to
inform him of the spot where the station stood, but
when the surface of the ground is broken, the traces
of a Roman city are still sufficiently distinct. The
church-yard is filled with fragments of red sandstone
blocks. At the depth of two feet, it contains
several distinct lines of foundations. Entire ‘lachrymatory’
vessels and fragments of unglazed jars and
urns have repeatedly been dug up. A small bronze
figure was recently found. When the canal was cut,
blocks of stone, blackened by smoke, were dug out
of the soil to the south-east of the church.</p>

<p class='c000'>A few inscribed stones have been found since Horsley’s
day, but none of them name the cohort which was
stationed in the camp. Hence we have no means of
knowing whether Watch-cross has been rightly
thrown out of the list of ‘stations along the line,’ and
whether Burgh is, as Horsley states it to be, the
<span class='sc'>Axelodunum</span> of the Notitia, or <span class='sc'>Congavata</span>, according
to the opinion of Hodgson.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the absence of more decided remains of the camp
or Wall, an examination of the church of this long
straggling town will reward the attention of the antiquary.
It is a good specimen of the fortified Border
churches. It has served the threefold purpose
of a church, a fortress, and a prison.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>In case of an inroad from the Scottish coast, the cattle appear
to have been shut up in the body of the church, and the
inhabitants to have had recourse to the large embattled
tower at its western end. The only entrance to this tower
is from the inside of the church, and it is secured by a ponderous
iron door, fastening with two large bolts. The walls of
the tower are seven feet thick. Its lowest apartment is a vaulted
chamber, lighted by three arrow-slits. At the south angle is
a spiral stone staircase, leading to two upper chambers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many of the stones of which the church is built,
are Roman, and exhibit reticulated tooling.</p>

<div class='sidenote c015'>KING EDWARD’S MONUMENT.</div>

<p class='c000'>Near to Burgh is the site on which the castle
of sir Hugh de Morville, one of the murderers
of Thomas à Becket, formerly stood. The adjoining
field is called—‘Hang-man-tree,’ doubtless
because my lord had his gallows here, always ready
for use. A neighbouring enclosure bears a designation
not less ominous—‘Spill-blood-holm.’ But the
most interesting historical memorial which the
neighbourhood of Burgh affords, is the monument to
king Edward I., which stands on the marsh.</p>

<p class='c014'>Longshanks had marshalled his army: his numerous host
lay encamped upon the sandy flat on the north of the town:
the waters of the Solway alone separated him from the objects
of his vengeance. Here the mighty Edward was called to
enter into conflict with an enemy whom he had often braved on
the battle-field, but who was now to approach him by a new
method of assault. In this struggle, his valour availed him
nothing, his chivalrous hosts could yield him no aid, and no
devoted Eleanor was there to abstract from his veins the subtle
poison which the king of terrors had infused. On Burgh-marsh
the ‘ruthless king’ breathed his last. A monument, represented
in the vignette at the close of this part, marks the spot.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>TOWER OF REPENTANCE.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>Another structure, on the opposite side of the
Firth, may be noticed by the traveller. The history
of the ‘Tower of Repentance’ is strikingly illustrative
of the disordered state of society in this
district before the union of the two kingdoms.</p>

<p class='c014'>A chieftain from the northern side having made a successful
inroad into the English border, was crossing the Solway
on his return, laden with booty, when a sudden storm arose.
In order to lighten his labouring vessel, he threw his prisoners
overboard in preference to the cattle which he had stolen.
The danger past, he was smitten with remorse. In order to
make such amends as he could, he built a beacon-tower which
overlooks the Solway, and to this day is called the Tower of
Repentance. Tradition avers that the penitent himself carried
all the stones used in its erection to the top of the hill. It
is not far from the town of Ecclefechan.</p>

<p class='c000'>In passing along the village of Burgh, the observing
visitor will notice the large number of boulder-stones,
some of them half a ton in weight, which
are strewed over the ground; several of them have
been used in forming the foundations of the cottages.
They are of granite, and in some distant age have
been wrenched from the summit of Criffel, the hill
which lends so much beauty to the landscape on the
northern side of the Solway.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the western side of the village of Dykesfield,
which we next encounter, is a common that contains
several earthen ramparts and temporary camps.</p>

<p class='c000'>Between Dykesfield and the next station, Drumburgh,
an extensive marsh occurs, which even now is
occasionally overflowed by the waters of the Solway.
Hodgson inclines to the belief, that the Wall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>ran directly across it. Horsley, however, took a
different view of the subject.</p>

<p class='c014'>From hence to Drumburgh Castle no vestige of the Wall
is to be seen; though I think it certain that the Wall did
not pass through the marsh, but by Boustead-hill and Easton,
for both tradition and matter of fact favour this course of it.
The country people often strike upon the Wall, and could tell
exactly several places through which, by this means, they
knew it had passed, and always by the side of the marsh.
Besides it is no way reasonable to suppose that the Romans
would build their Wall within tide-mark.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>EASTON-MARSH.</div>

<p class='c000'>After careful inquiry, I am disposed to adopt
Horsley’s view; even now, stones which appear to be
Wall-stones, are turned up by the operations of the
husbandmen in the line which the Wall is supposed
to have taken by Boustead and Easton. It need
not be a subject of surprise, that the Wall in this
district has been so thoroughly removed, as there
is no quarry within a convenient distance, and the
Wall, therefore, has been the source from which the
inhabitants of the country have drawn their supply
of building stones. The Romans seem to have gone
to Howrigg quarry, which is not less than eight
miles south of the Barrier, for their facing-stones;
those which they used for the interior of the Wall
correspond in character with the proceeds of Stone-pot-scar,
a quarry on the north shore of the Solway.</p>

<p class='c000'>We must now part company with the Vallum.
This wonderful earth-work, which has outlived the
accidents of seventeen centuries, and which we have
traced, with but few interruptions, from the modern
representative of <span class='sc'>Pons Ælii</span> to this point, is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>observed going beyond it. As the Vallum falls
short of the Wall at its eastern extremity by about
four miles, so it does at its western. Horsley, who
wrote more than a century ago, and who, consequently,
had better opportunities of judging than
we can now have, says—</p>

<p class='c014'>Whether Hadrian’s work (the Vallum) has been continued
any further than this marsh, or to the water-side beyond
Drumburgh, is doubtful. But I am pretty confident that it
was not carried on so far as the Wall of Severus at this end,
any more than at the other. And I can by no means yield to
Mr. Gordon’s sentiments, that the one, for a good space at
each end, was built upon the foundation of the other. However,
it is certain that from the side of the marsh to the west
end of the Wall there is no appearance of Hadrian’s work, or
any thing belonging to it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>DRUMBURGH.</div>
<p class='c000'><em>DRUMBURGH</em> contains distinct remains of a
small stationary camp. This, if Watch-cross be rejected,
was the sixteenth station of the Wall, and
consequently, the <span class='sc'>Axelodunum</span> of the Notitia, which
was garrisoned by the first cohort of the Spaniards.
The camp is on the grounds of Richard Lawson, esq.
The ramparts are well defined, as well as the ditch
which surrounds them. The whole area is covered
with a luxuriant sward, and its northern margin is
shaded by some thriving ash-trees. No portion of
the Wall remains in its vicinity, but its present proprietor
remembers witnessing the removal of the
foundation. The northern rampart of the station
did not come up to the Wall, but was removed a
few yards from it; probably the military way ran
between the station and the Wall. The station at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>Barr-hill, on the Antonine Wall, is similarly situated.</p>

<p class='c000'>South of the station is a well, enclosed by a circular
wall of Roman masonry. It is still in use,
though the water is drawn from it by a pump.</p>

<p class='c000'>The mediæval castle, of which there are considerable
remains, is a very fine specimen of the ancient
fortified manor-house. It is built of Roman stones.
Extensive alterations were made upon it in the reign
of Henry VIII. The habitable part of it is now
occupied as a farm-house.</p>

<p class='c004'>The tranquillity of this region was not always what
it now is.</p>

<p class='c014'>Standing on the northern rampart of the station, Mr. Lawson,
the aged proprietor, directed the attention of the Pilgrim-party
of 1849 to a small cottage on the opposite shore.
‘There,’ said he, ‘lived a Scottish reaver, who in the days of my
grandfather made, on nineteen successive Easter-eves, a
successful foray on the English side. A twentieth time he
prepared to go; his family remonstrated, he however persisted,
saying that this should be his last attempt. Our
people were prepared for him and slew him.’ Some of
the party asked ‘what notice did the law take of the transaction?’
'None; the law which could not protect a man, would
not punish him for taking the law into his own hands.'</p>

<p class='c000'>Now, nearly arrived at the western extremity of
the great Barrier, we meet with but few traces of its
characteristic masonry; enough, however, remains
to lure us pleasantly to our journey’s end.</p>

<p class='c000'>In cutting the canal from Carlisle to the Solway
Firth, in 1823, a prostrate forest of oak was discovered,
which belonged to an age anterior to that of
Hadrian. The engineer of the canal says—</p>

<div class='sidenote'>PRIMEVAL FOREST.</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>A subterraneous forest was cut through in the excavation
of the canal, near the banks of the Solway Firth, about half a
mile north-west of the village of Glasson, and extending into
Kirklands. The trees were all prostrate, and they had fallen,
with little deviation, in a northerly direction, or a little eastward
of it.—Some short trunks, of two or three feet in height,
were in the position of their natural growth; but although
the trees, with the exception of their alburnum and all the
branches, were perfectly sound, yet the extremity of the
trunks, whether fallen or standing, were so rugged, that it was
not discoverable whether the trees had been cut down, or had
fallen by a violent storm. The level upon which the trunks
lay, was a little below that of high tides, and from eight to
ten feet below the surface of the ground they were embedded
in; which, excepting the superficial soil, is a soft blue clay,
having the appearance of marine alluvion.... Although
the precise period when this forest fell is not ascertainable,
there is a positive proof that it must have been long prior to
the building of the Wall because the foundations of the Wall
passed obliquely over it, and lay three or four feet above the
level of the trees.—<cite>Arch. Æl.</cite> ii. 117.</p>

<p class='c000'>The forest extends over a considerable tract of
ground. It is probable that it was overthrown by a
tempest from the south or south-west, at a time
when the sea occupied a lower level than it does at
present. The wood was so sound, that it was used
in common with other oak timber in forming the
jetties at the outlet of the canal into the Solway
Firth. The president’s chair of the Society of Antiquaries,
Newcastle-upon-Tyne, is formed of it.</p>

<p class='c004'>At Port-Carlisle is a mound resembling an ancient
British barrow, called Fisher’s-cross. About half-a-mile
to the westward of it is another which has
been somewhat encroached upon by the road that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>runs along the margin of the Solway, and is denominated
Knock’s-cross. The proverb is common
throughout Cumberland, 'As old as Knock’s-cross.'</p>

<p class='c000'>In the front of the Steam-packet hotel, Port-Carlisle,
is built up the fragment of a small Roman altar, bearing
the inscription, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='fss'>SVIS MATRIBVS</span></span>. It is one of the
numerous instances that we meet with, along the line
of the Wall, of altars dedicated to the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Deæ Matres</em></span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote c015'>BOWNESS.</div>
<p class='c000'>Between Port-Carlisle and Bowness, the site of
the Wall may be traced nearly the whole way; not
unfrequently the foundations of it and its fosse may
be discerned. In one place some large stones resembling
those used in forming the gateways of the
mile-castles will be noticed. In Brand’s day some
considerable portions of the Wall remained, between
these points. He says—</p>

<p class='c014'>About three quarters of a mile to the east of Bowness,
some fragments of Severus’ Wall remain, of a great height;
on measuring one of them, we found it to be about eight feet
high; it was bound and overgrown with ivy in a most
picturesque manner. The facing-stones on both sides have
been taken away.</p>

<p class='c000'>On my first visit to Bowness, I saw a portion of
it as Hodgson describes it—</p>

<p class='c014'>It is six feet high. Its rugged and weathered core, still
hard as a rock, is thickly bearded with sloe-thorn and hazel,
and mantled below with ivy and honey-suckle.</p>

<p class='c000'>This interesting object has been entirely removed,
which is the more to be regretted, as no advantage
has been gained by its destruction; it served as a
fence between two fields.</p>

<div class='sidenote c015'>TERMINATION OF THE WALL.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span><em>BOWNESS</em> is the name of the low, bow-shaped
ness, or peninsula, at the extreme point of the left
bank of the Solway Firth. It is slightly elevated above
the surrounding country, as is plainly seen when it
is viewed from a distance. A little to the east of
the site of the station, the Solway is easily fordable
at low water; but no one, in the memory of the inhabitants
of these parts, has forded the estuary westward
of the town. This circumstance would render
Bowness a fit place at which to terminate the
Barrier Wall. With difficulty the antiquary detects
some slight traces of the walls of the station, its
southern lines near the church being those which
are most apparent. No quarry being within several
miles of the spot, the Wall and station have furnished
the materials of which the church and most of the
habitations of the town are composed. A small altar
built up in the front of a barn in the principal street,
has an inscription importing that it was dedicated to
Jupiter the best and greatest, by Sulpicius Secundianus,
the tribune of the cohort for the safety of our
lords, the emperors Galbus and Volusianus.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bowness may be the <span class='sc'>Gabrosentum</span> of the Notitia;
Horsley reckoning Watch-cross among the stations of
the line, conceives it to be <span class='sc'>Tunnocelum</span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Over that beautiful expanse of waters bounded by
the Criffel and other Dumfriesshire hills, which we
see from the somewhat elevated beach that has
formed the northern margin of the station, the eye
of the Roman sentinel must often have listlessly
rolled, as he paced his tedious hours away. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>memory of Roman and Caledonian feuds gives to the
picture, as we now behold it, a charm enhanced
by contrast with the state of things which existed
in ancient days. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>CHANGE OF TIMES.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>The hills have the aspect
which they formerly bore, the waters of the
Solway ebb and flow as they were wont, the same
clear sky spans the vault of heaven which was outstretched
in Roman days;—but then, the occupants
of the opposite shores scowled upon each other with
deadly hate, and planned the means of mutual
slaughter. Stealthily they cast the net and threw
the leister into the margin of the sea, or when they
openly appeared upon the waters, it was in galleys
armed for sanguinary aggression;—now, with each
returning tide, the fisherman plies his peaceful trade,
fearless of harm, and the inhabitants of both the
northern and the southern shore hail each other
as friends and fellow-countrymen.</p>

Altho’ we have now traversed the
line of the mural Barrier
from one extremity to
the other, and
examined all
the camps that
lie upon its
track, we have
met with but
seventeen or
eighteen of the
twenty-three
that are mentioned
in the Notitia as stations <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>per lineam Valli</em></span>.
According to Horsley, five remain to be accounted
for, and according to Hodgson, who rejects Watch-cross,
six. These must be sought for among the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>stations which support the great Barrier on its northern
or southern side. As the names of the camps
north of the Wall have been ascertained by independent
authority, and as they do not correspond<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>SECONDARY FORTS OF THE NOTITIA.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
with those of the remaining stations of the Notitia,
it is agreed on all hands, that the list is to be completed
from among the fortified places which support
the Barrier on the south. Without dwelling upon
the reasons which have guided the conjectures, (for
they are but conjectures at the best), of the great
author of the Britannia Romana, and other antiquaries,
in appropriating the remaining names supplied
by the Notitia, it may be sufficient to say, that as the
primary stations, so far as they have been ascertained,
are found to be arranged in that document
in regular consecutive order, beginning at the eastern
extremity of the line, it is conceived to be highly
probable that a similar course has been pursued
with the secondary camps. If, therefore, we
could correctly ascertain which, of all the camps that
dot the country in the southern vicinage of the Wall,
are mural stations, we might, with tolerable plausibility,
bestow upon them in their order the remaining
names of the Notitia roll. But this is a task
of great difficulty, and considerable uncertainty must
necessarily attend the appropriation of the names
upon this principle.</p>

<p class='c000'>An examination of the forts themselves, however,
on both sides of the Wall, is a task equally easy and
instructive, and it is one which is essential to a correct
estimate of the strength of the principal fortification—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>Wall. Sir John Clark must have altogether
overlooked the existence of these supporting
stations, when he wrote in the following strain to
his friend Gale:—</p>

<p class='c014'>After all, I cannot but take notice of two things with regard
to the Wall, that have given me great matter of speculation.
The first is, why it was made at all, for it could never
be a proper defence, and perhaps at Bowness less than at any
other place, since our barbarian forefathers on the north side
could pass over at low water, and if the sea was higher or
deeper than it is now, could make their attacks from the
north-east side by land.—The second is, why the Scots historians,
vain enough by nature, have not taken more pains to
describe the Wall, a performance which did their ancestors
more honour than all the trifling stories put together which
they have transmitted to us. It is true the Romans walled
out humanity from us; but it is as certain they thought the
Caledonians a very formidable people, when they at so much
labour and cost built this Wall; as before they had made a
Vallum between the Forth and the Clyde.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE BARRIER NOT A NAKED WALL.</div>

<p class='c000'>The Romans did not oppose to the enemy a single
line of fortification only, which, by some casual negligence
on their part, or a sudden exertion of desperate
bravery on the side of their antagonists,
might in a moment be rendered useless. In addition
to the Wall, stationary camps were planted
along its whole course, at a few miles distance from it,
both to the north and the south; so that, in reality,
a triple line of fortresses was opposed to the passage
of an enemy from either quarter. These subsidiary
stations were connected with the garrisons on the
Wall, and to some extent with each other, by good
roads. In maintaining a surveillance over an enemy,
whether to the north or the south of the chief member
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>of the fortification, in furnishing a secure retreat
for the soldiery when venturing beyond their line,
and in stemming the first shock of an onset, the importance
of the out-stations cannot be over-rated.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE SUPPORTING FORTS OF DIFFERENT ERAS.</div>

<p class='c000'>It is not contended that all the stations which are
immediately on the north and south of the Wall were
erected with the express view of supporting it. Several
of them doubtless were, but others, there is
reason to believe, were made by Agricola, before the
Wall was projected or thought of. All that is necessary
for us to admit is, that they contributed
materially to the strength of the main structure, and
as such, formed an important element in the calculations
of the engineer of the Wall.</p>

<p class='c000'>In taking a cursory survey of the supporting stations
of the line, it may be well, first, to examine
those which defended its eastern extremity: next,
those which are upon Watling-street—the great
channel of communication between the northern and
southern sections of Britain on the east side of the
summit level: afterwards, those which are on the
Maiden-way—the road on the west of the summit
level: and reserve to the last, the important stations
which strengthened the works on the northern and
southern shores of the Solway.</p>

<p class='c000'>About the reading of the first line of this inscription,
which Brand translates, ‘a circular harbour for
the shipping,’ there is some uncertainty; but there is
no doubt about the other lines, which import that—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c017'>
    <div>Caius Julius Maximinus, <em>of</em> the Sixth Legion, victorious,</div>
    <div>in the performance of a vow, erected <em>this</em> temple.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The mere circumstance of its selection as the site
of a temple, proves this to have been a place of some
importance in the Roman age. The name of the builder
of the temple fixes, with a near approach to precision,
the date of its dedication. Caius Julius Verus
Maximinus was a Thracian shepherd of great personal
strength; he attracted at an early period of his
life the notice of Septimius Severus, and under
Caracalla attained to the rank of centurion. On the
assassination of Alexander Severus, in 235, he assumed
the purple, and was himself assassinated in
238. He probably accompanied Septimius Severus
into Britain, and on this occasion erected the temple
commemorated by this inscription. The following
amusing account of the personal qualifications of
Maximinus, is given in Dr. William Smith’s admirable
Dictionary of Biography and Mythology.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>His height exceeded eight feet, but his person was not
ungraceful, for the size and muscular developement of his limbs
were in proportion to his stature, the circumference of his
thumb being equal to that of a woman’s wrist, so that the
bracelet of his wife served him for a ring.... The remarkable
magnitude of his eyes communicated a bold and imposing
expression to his features. He was able single-handed to
drag a loaded wagon, could with his fist knock out the
grinders, and with a kick break the leg of a horse; while his
appetite was such, that in a day he could eat forty pounds of
meat, and drink an amphora of wine. At least such are the
statements of the ancient writers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nearly all traces of the camp at Tynemouth have
been erased. Some years after the modern well
near the entrance into the castle was sunk, another
of wide diameter, and cased with masonry, was discovered,
in consequence of the falling in of its covering;
it is supposed to be Roman, but was again
closed by order of the commander of the garrison,
before it could be properly inspected.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>MEDIÆVAL REMAINS.</div>

<p class='c000'>The mediæval remains at Tynemouth are of great
interest. The castellated gateway which formerly
defended the approaches to the priory precincts has
been sadly mutilated by tasteless renovators, but the
ecclesiastical buildings, which have happily been
left to the mercy of the elements, exhibit even in
their ruins, much of their original beauty. The
church-yard, affords a resting place to many who
for years had been tossed upon the restless ocean,
and to some who, venturing into the briny flood in
search of health and pleasure, met with an untimely
end. Friendly tomb-stones, speak of them; some
names, however, are in danger of being forgotten.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>The murdered body of Oswin king of Deira, was
deposited in the church-yard of this monastery. Here
too, were buried Malcolm Canmore king of Scotland—the
friend of the Saxon—and his son, prince
Edward, so named after his maternal ancestor the
Confessor; they were both slain in the same fatal
battle fought near Alnwick, A.D. 1094. Queen
Margaret, through whom her present majesty, queen
Victoria, derives her Saxon blood, survived the
slaughter of her husband and son but a few days.</p>

<div class='sidenote c015'>BLAKE-CHESTERS.</div>
<p class='c000'><em>BLAKE-CHESTERS</em>, at the high end of North
Shields, is the site of another camp. Waterville, the
residence of George Rippon, esq., is within its
bounds. Several carved stones, much worn by the
weather, are on the ground, and many Roman building-stones
may be observed in the contiguous fences.</p>

<p class='c000'>These are not the only camps which were situated
on the east coast north of the Wall. Hodgson says—</p>

<p class='c000'>From the Wall northward, are numerous small
square camps, strengthened with deep ditches, scattered
over the country, as if they had been intended
for rural purposes.<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c012'><sup>[128]</sup></a> A line of them may still be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>traced through the parishes of Long-Benton, past
Cramlington, into the Plessy grounds.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is every probability that the site of Morpeth
castle was fortified by the Romans. Some portions
of the curtain-wall still standing have been pronounced
by competent judges to be of Roman masonry.</p>

<div class='sidenote c015'>FORT AT SOUTH SHIELDS.</div>
<p class='c000'><em>SHIELDS LAWE.</em>—The southern shore of the
estuary of the Tyne was as well protected as the northern.
A camp, comprehending several acres, stood
upon the slightly elevated headland at South Shields
called the Lawe. The excellence of the situation, as a
post of observation, is proved by the acts of the
pilots who have planted a beacon and erected many of
their residences upon it. In 1798, the foundations of
many old walls, which obstructed the plough, were
removed. The lowest course of some of them consisted
‘of rough whinstone, evidently brought from
the shore, as the barnacles were still adhering to
them.’ The remains of a hypocaust were discovered
at the same time. Several coins were also found,
and as some of them were of the reign of Valentinian
(A.D. 380), it may be presumed that the station was
in use only a short time before the desertion of
Britain by the Romans. An altar, despoiled of
its inscription, which was found in this station,
is preserved in the library at Durham.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ancient military-way called the Wreckendike
terminated at this station. Until a recent period,
one branch of it could be traced by Lay-gate, the
Dean-bridge, and Jarrow-slake, to Gateshead-fell.
It also led to Lanchester, Binchester, and the South.</p>

<div class='sidenote c015'>STATION AT JARROW.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span><em>JARROW.</em>—At nearly the same distance from
the camp on the Lawe, on the south side of the river,
as Blake-chesters is from Tynemouth, on the north,
the site of another Roman fort occurs. Hodgson,
who first drew attention to it, says—</p>

<p class='c014'>At Jarrow, an oblong square of about three acres, with its
corners rounded off, overlooking the estuary of Jarrow-slake,
and fronting on the south the bank of the navigable stream
called the Don, is, on good grounds, supposed to have been the
site of a station or fortified town of the Romans. Under-ground
foundations of a wall of strong masonry mark out its area on
every side, and include within them the site of the present
church and church-yard, and some ragged remains of the ancient
monastery of Jarrow. In digging up part of the remains
of these walls in 1812, a silver denarius of Aulus
Vitellius was found embedded in mortar in the heart of the
wall; and when the road was formed past Jarrow-row, in
1803, two square pavements of Roman brick were discovered.</p>

<div id='p323'  class='figright id019'>
<img src='images/i_p323.jpg' alt='323' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Two inscribed stones have
been found here which give
strength to the opinion that
Jarrow was a Roman station.
One of them, now at Somerset-house,
is shewn in the
wood-cut. As Brand observes,
it is interesting as containing the name of
our island at length. It has been read—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c017'>
    <div><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='sc'>DIFFVSIS PROVINC<em>IIS IN</em> BRITANNIA AD VTRVMQVE</span></span></div>
    <div><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='sc'>O<em>CEANVM</em> EXERCITVS <em>FECIT</em></span>.</span>—</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The army erected this, on the extension of the Roman
dominion in Britain, from the western to the eastern sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>The other stone has formed part of an altar erected
in honour of the adopted sons of Hadrian.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>The church of Jarrow is a simple building, but it
contains some undoubted Saxon work. Within the
walls of the ancient monastery, some portions of
which exist, the venerable Bede passed his useful
and unostentatious life. Of him, Surtees, the Historian
of Durham, observes—</p>

<p class='c014'>The lamp of learning, trimmed by the hand of a single
monastic who never passed the limits of his Northumbrian
province, irradiated from the cell of Jarrow, the Saxon realm
of England with a clear and steady light; and when Bede
died, history reversed her torch, and quenched it in deep night.</p>

<p class='c000'>This venerable man died, A.D., 735, in the act of
completing a translation into Anglo-Saxon of the
Gospel of St. John. His name would have been
worthy of all reverence, even had he done nothing
more than give to his countrymen the Scriptures in
their vernacular tongue. It must however be confessed
that ‘he fell on evil times,’ and that his works
embody many of the errors and superstitions of the
period.</p>

<div class='sidenote c015'>WARDLEY.</div>
<p class='c000'><em>WARDLEY.</em>—An ancient entrenchment containing
an area of upwards of six acres, may yet be
observed at Wardley, in the parish of Jarrow, nearly
opposite to Wallsend. Hodgson, who resided for
several years in this neighbourhood, was not able to
learn that any Roman antiquities were ever found in
it. He was disposed, however, to think that it belonged
to the Roman era. It may have been a summer
encampment of the garrison at Wallsend, and
as such, would contribute not a little to their comfort,
and the defence of the river.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>Wardley, there is some reason to suppose, is the
Wredelau of the chroniclers, where the body of
St. Cuthbert became immoveable, and where the
wandering monastics received the revelation which
directed them to Durham.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such were the strongholds by which the garrisons
on the eastern extremity of the Wall were assisted
in maintaining their ground against the foe.</p>

<p class='c000'>Watling-street, running north and south, crossed
the Wall at about twenty miles from its termination
at Wallsend. The modern turnpike-road
between Corbridge and West-Woodburn adheres
very closely to its track, and occasionally the ancient
ditches protecting it on both sides are to be seen.
Its stations were probably planted by Agricola, but
were not on that account less useful to the soldiers of
the Barrier. Our examination of them must be brief.</p>

<p class='c004'><em>CHEW-GREEN.</em>—Here, close upon the Scottish
border, is an extensive Roman camp; investigation
is necessary to decide whether it was of a temporary
or permanent character; it is probably only an
earthen entrenchment.</p>

<div class='sidenote c015'>HIGH-ROCHESTER.</div>
<p class='c000'>BREMENIUM, or High Rochester, is a station
of considerable interest. It stands upon Watling-street,
at about twenty two miles north of the Wall.
Between Rochester and Chew-green the pavement of
the Roman road may be distinctly traced for many
miles together. The site on which the station stands
is high and much exposed; but, in a military point of
view, it is very strong. On all sides the ground slopes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>from it, but on the north it sinks so rapidly, as to give
it the protection of a bold breastwork. The walls
of the station are stronger than those of the forts
on the line of the Wall; they are not only thicker,
but are composed of larger stones.<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>BREMENIUM.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> A moat has
surrounded the camp; on the east side, which is by
nature the weakest, two ditches have been formed,
which there is reason to believe were supplied with
water. All the gateways may be traced with considerable
distinctness; the southern one has suffered
least from depredation. The interior of the station
is filled with the ruins of buildings; some of them
would well repay examination. Of the modern structures
which have been raised within its area, two are
peel-houses or fortified dwellings of considerable
strength. The suburban buildings of the station have
been situated on the west side, where their foundations
still appear. Here they would be protected by
the valley along which, at about a quarter of a mile’s
distance, the Sills-burn runs. The stones of the
ramparts are strongly marked by the diamond
broaching. The station contains an area of four
acres and three roods.</p>

<p class='c000'>At about half-a-mile distant from the station, in a
south-east direction, there have recently been discovered
the foundations of some Roman <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>cippi</em></span> or
funeral monuments. They are close by the road,
and as was usually the case, on the south side of
it. Three of them are square, the fourth, which is
the largest, is circular. The masonry of all of them
is remarkably fresh. The circular tomb has two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>courses of stones standing, besides the flat stones
which form the foundation. On clearing out the interior,
a jar of unburnt clay was found; it had no
bones in it. The natural soil was found to have
been acted upon by fire to the depth of more than a
foot. Mixed with the rubbish was a quantity of
white ashes. A coin of Alexander Severus was
found within the area, a circumstance which strengthens
the presumption that the station was occupied
by the Romans until a late period.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are several temporary camps in this neighbourhood.
Persons well acquainted with the country,
and who have noticed the peculiar structure of
Roman roads, give it as their opinion that a Roman
way has proceeded eastwards from Rochester by
Yatesfield, Potts-Durtrees, Yardhope, Holystone,
and Glanton, in a direction which renders it probable
that it joined that branch of Watling-street
which traversed the eastern side of Northumberland,
and is often inelegantly termed the Devil’s-causeway.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some distance south of the station, and near to
the point at which Watling-street crosses the modern
high-way, (in front of Redesdale cottage) the remains
of an ancient lime-kiln were recently found. It was
situated on the slope of a rocky hill, and had been
formed partly by the excavation of the natural rock,
and partly by regular courses of masonry. In order
to take advantage of the form of the ground, the mouth
for drawing out the lime was placed in front. The
stones were much reddened by the action of fire, and
portions of lime were adhering to them. There is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>excellent limestone near the kiln, and several beds
of coal are in the vicinity. Several heaps of rubbish,
on the line of Watling-street, where the coal crops
out, render it probable that this mineral was wrought
by the Romans.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE ITINERARY OF ANTONINE.</div>

<p class='c000'>In ascertaining the Roman names of the stations
on the line of the Wall, reference has hitherto been
made only to the Notitia Imperii. Another document
has come down to our time, of which we
may now avail ourselves—the Itinerary of Antonine.
It does not mention any of the stations immediately
upon the Wall, but names some to the north and
and south of it. It is a sort of road-book of the
whole Roman empire, and is supposed to have
been made by one of the emperors who bore the
name of Antoninus. Horsley thinks that Caracalla
is best entitled to be accounted its author. That
part of it which relates to Britain contains fifteen
routes; the towns upon each are named, and the
distances from one to another given in Roman
miles. The aid which such a document gives in
ascertaining the ancient designations of the stations
that occur in it is obvious. The first ‘Iter’ is
entitled ‘A Route from the Limit, that is, from the
Wall, to <span class='sc'>Prætorium</span>, 156 miles.’ It begins thus—</p>

<p class='c000'>That Rochester is the <span class='sc'>Bremenium</span> of the first
route, is established by the discovery of an altar in
it, which professes to be erected by the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>duplares</em></span> of
the exploratory troops stationed at <span class='sc'>Bremenium</span>.
In no position would exploratory troops be more
needed than here, and no place could be more appropriately
fixed upon as the starting point of an
‘Iter’ than this. Several of the inscriptions belonging
to this station bear the name of Caracalla. Both
<span class='sc'>Bremenium</span> and <span class='sc'>Habitancum</span> seem to have undergone
important repairs in the time of this emperor.</p>

<p class='c000'>Eight miles south of High Rochester, and on the
line of Watling-street, is another Roman station.</p>

<div class='sidenote c015'>HABITANCUM.</div>
<p class='c000'>HABITANCUM is the name which Camden,
and Horsley, on the authority of a stone found near
the station, and which was inspected by them both,
agree in bestowing upon the modern Risingham.</p>

<p class='c000'>The position of <span class='sc'>Habitancum</span> will strike a stranger
with surprise. Instead of occupying an eminence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>it is placed in a valley, and close upon the banks of
the Rede. Hills environ it, though not very closely,
on every side. They who, in early spring, have
been exposed on the neighbouring heights to the
sleety shower, will know the reason of the selection.
The climate of Risingham is peculiarly mild. The
west wind blows with the steadiness of a trade wind,
and the harsh east seldom descends into this favoured
valley. The village of Woodburn is on the opposite
side of the river. The lines in ‘Rokeby’ well characterize
the spot, though its wood is fast disappearing—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c005'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Where Rede upon his margin sees</div>
      <div class='line'>Sweet Woodburn’s cottages and trees.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Notwithstanding the secluded nature of the situation,
it is not destitute of military strength. The
Rede defends it on the north, which was the point of
greatest danger; and, excepting on the south, where
an out-post seems to have been maintained, an enemy
could be descried long before approaching the camp.</p>

<p class='c000'>The walls of the station have been constructed of
the same strong masonry as those of <span class='sc'>Bremenium</span>.
Owing to the excellence of the stone, the marks of
the tool upon them are peculiarly distinct. In the
hill behind the station, called the Bell-knowe, the
ancient quarrymen have left numerous wedge-holes
and other indications of their labours. Although a
fosse usually surrounded the ramparts of a station,
and although sir Walter Scott has sung of—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c005'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The moated mound of Risingham,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'>RISINGHAM.</div>

<p class='c000'>Risingham does not appear to have been defended in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>this way. In company with the owner of the property,
who had a little before thorough-drained the
ground bordering on the south and east sides of
the camp, I sought in vain for any traces of a
fosse. The ruins of the interior would yield a
rich harvest to the careful explorer. Recent excavations
have revealed some chambers of great interest;
but, with the exception of those near the
south-east corner, they have been removed as soon
as displayed. Some of the buildings were evident
restorations of prior structures: a circumstance
which confirms the conclusion deduced from other
considerations, that the station was long occupied by
the Romans. After being deserted, a portion of its
north rampart has been carried away by the river.
Until recently, the remains of the bridge by which
Watling-street crossed the Rede, on the west side
of the station, were distinctly visible. The soil which
covers the camp is peculiarly rich, being replete with
animal matter. Many important antiquarian treasures
have been procured from this spot. The large
slab, six feet long, which forms the ground-work of
the initial letter at the beginning of this part, was
found among the ruins of the south gateway. The
inscription mentions the restoration of the gate with
the walls of the station (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='fss'>PORTAM CUM MURIS VETUSTATE
DILAPSIS</span></span>). The upper part, which is lost, probably
contained the name of Severus; in what remains,
some of the titles of Caracalla appear. Geta’s
name seems to have been erased. The stone is now
at Newcastle. Another very fine slab found at this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>station, is at Cambridge. Some of the altars discovered
here will be described in the last part.</p>

<p class='c000'>Horsley is naturally surprised that <span class='sc'>Habitancum</span> is
not named in the Antonine Itinerary. One conjecture
in which he indulges, in order to account for
this is, ‘that the station might be neglected before
the reign of Caracalla,’ which is proved to be unfounded
by the slab already referred to, and by the
discovery last year of some large fragments of inscriptions,
mentioning that emperor by his title
Adiabenicus. A second supposition which he entertains
may be the correct one. He says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c005'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Possibly Risingham might be looked on as too near to</div>
      <div class='line'>Rochester, to make it another mansion in this route. And</div>
      <div class='line'>though two places are sometimes set down in the same iter,</div>
      <div class='line'>which are at no greater distance, yet other circumstances</div>
      <div class='line'>might render this proper at one place, and not so at another.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It is not improbable that the two stations may have
been under one command. The exposed situation
of <span class='sc'>Bremenium</span> would render it highly desirable
that the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>exploratores</em></span>, after having battled for a season
with the elements and the Caledonians, should
be allowed a period of comparative relief in some
more sheltered spot, such as <span class='sc'>Habitancum</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote c015'>CORSTOPITUM.</div>
<p class='c000'>CORSTOPITUM is the next place that occurs in
this ‘iter,’ in which it is set down as being twenty
miles from <span class='sc'>Bremenium</span>. At the distance of about
twenty-three English miles from the camp of High
Rochester, and on the line of Watling-street, are now
to be found the remains of the station of Corchester.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>CORCHESTER.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>This, which is a little to the west of the town of Corbridge,
is doubtless the ancient <span class='sc'>Corstopitum</span>. The
station, which is now entirely levelled, and can with
difficulty be traced, has stood upon a gently swelling
knoll on the north bank of the Tyne. A bridge, the
foundations of which the floods of seventeen centuries
have spared, connected it with the opposite bank of the
river; the remains of this bridge are precisely similar
in appearance to those on the North Tyne at <span class='sc'>Cilurnum</span>.
The bridge has crossed the river obliquely, a
circumstance which corroborates the opinion formerly
expressed, that the bridges in these parts
consisted of horizontal roadways, supported upon
piers—unless, indeed, we suppose that the Romans
were acquainted with the construction of the skew-arch.
Hutchinson states, that a ‘military way passes
from this place south-west through Dilston Park,
over Hexham Fell to Old Town in Allendale, and
meets with the Maiden-way at Whitley Castle.’
Abundance of medals, inscriptions, and other Roman
antiquities, have been found at Corchester. Pieces of
Roman bricks and pots are spread over the surface
of the ground. The church at Corbridge has been
raised at the expense of the station. Horsley conceives
that this fort was abandoned before the compilation
of the Notitia, as it is not mentioned in that
document. It is about two miles south of the Wall.</p>

<p class='c000'>The large altar which is figured in the initial
letter at the beginning of this volume, formed,
in Horsley’s days, the shaft of the market-cross
at Corbridge. It is now on the stairs of the entrance-tower,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>at the castle of Newcastle-upon-Tyne.
The inscription is defaced, but the carving
on both sides remains; on the one side is a
soldier, armed—the representative probably of war;
on the other is a warrior, having laid aside his weapons,
dragging an amphora of wine—a picture, emblematic
of peace. The singular use made of this heathen
relic suggests the insertion here of the story of the
‘Fairy stone,’ as it is still told in this neighbourhood.</p>

<p class='c014'>A Roman altar in the vicinity of Bywell was, during the
‘troublesome times’ of 1715, put to a use little contemplated
either by the ancients or moderns. It was employed as the
post-office of the non-juring gentry of the district. The
parties, wishing to keep up a correspondence with each
other, arranged to deposit their communications in a
hollow of the altar. In the gray of the morning little girls
clad in green, and trained to the task, approached the stone
with a dancing step, and, having got the letters, retired with
antic gestures. So well did they perform their part that they
were mistaken for fairies, and the object of their visits was not
discovered for a long time afterwards. The stone was known
by the name of the Fairy stone.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>CORBRIDGE LANX.</div>
<p class='c000'>But the greatest curiosity which has been discovered
at <span class='sc'>Corstopitum</span>, is the silver <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>lanx</em></span>, or dish, which
is represented on the next page. A piece of plate
so massive, is of rare occurrence in the stations of
the North. It is in the possession of the duke of
Northumberland. There is an accurate cast of it in
the Newcastle Museum of Antiquities.</p>

<div id='p335'  class='figcenter id012'>
<img src='images/i_p335.jpg' alt='Corbridge Lanx' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c014'>'It was found (says Mr. Robert Cay, in a letter of 4th March
1734) near Corbridge, by some ignorant poor people who
have cut off the feet in such a vile barbarous manner, that
they have broke two holes through the table, and a small
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>piece off one of the corners too.' It is 19½ inches long, and
15 broad; it weighs about 150 ounces. The rim of the plate
rises nearly an inch above the interior. The figures have been
punched into form. Gale’s conjecture as to its use is probably
the correct one. ‘This is big enough (he says) to contain
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>exta</em></span> of a sheep, or other small victims, which seems to me
to be the likeliest employment for it, and that it was one of
these sacrificing utensils that Virgil calls <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Lances</em></span>:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c019'>
    <div><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lancibus et pandis fumantia reddimus exta.</span>’</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The principal figures on the plate are probably, those of Diana,
Minerva, Juno, Vesta, and Apollo.</p>

<p class='c014'>On the left side of the design is Diana, armed with a bow
and arrow. Below her feet is an urn with water flowing from
it; in front of her, is an altar with an offering, of a globular
form, upon it, and below the altar, is a dog of the greyhound
species, looking up to the goddess.</p>

<p class='c014'>The next figure is Minerva. She wears a helmet, and her
breast is adorned with the Gorgon’s head. A spear is in her
left hand. The thumb and first two fingers of her right hand
are uplifted, as if in the act of bestowing a benediction.</p>

<p class='c014'>The next figure is supposed to be Juno, though no symbol
is given by which she can be decisively distinguished. Her
right hand is uplifted in a manner similar to Minerva’s. At
her feet lies a dead buck.</p>

<p class='c014'>Vesta succeeds. She is seated; part of her peplus or mantle
is drawn over her head; the two fore-fingers of her left
hand, which is apparently resting upon her bosom, are upraised.
Beneath the goddess is an altar with the fire
burning.</p>

<p class='c014'>On the right of the piece is Apollo, standing under a canopy.
His bow is in his left hand, a flower in his right. His
lyre is on the ground by his side, and a griffin is below him.</p>

<p class='c014'>An eagle and some other birds are among the branches of
the tree in the upper part of the piece.</p>

<p class='c014'>Under the whole representation some recondite meaning is
probably concealed, which can only be a subject of conjecture.

<div class='sidenote c015'>HEXHAM CRYPT.</div>
<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span><em>HEXHAM</em> is generally admitted by antiquaries
to have been a Roman town, though the proof of it
is not absolutely decisive. St. Wilfrid built a church
and monastery here about the year 673, after the Roman
manner, which was considered the wonder of the
age. We are told by the historians of that period that
‘secret cells and subterranean oratories were laid with
wondrous industry beneath’ the building. Some vaults
<span id='p339' class='figleft id025'><img src='images/i_p339.jpg' alt='Crypt of Hexham Abbey Church' class='ig001' /></span>still remaining
probably formed
the crypt
of this ancient
structure. The
stones which
compose this
under-ground
building are all
Roman; the peculiar
mode in
which they are
chiselled is exhibited
in the
annexed wood
cut, representing
one of its
chambers. The walls exhibit several Roman mouldings
and cornices, besides inscriptions.<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c012'><sup>[130]</sup></a> It is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>likely that these stones would be brought from Corbridge
(the nearest Roman station, if Hexham be
not one), which is on the other side of the river, and
three miles distant; especially as there is abundance
<span id='p340' class='figright id025'><img src='images/i_p340.jpg' alt='Slab to Severus at Hexham' class='ig001' /></span>of stone in the immediate
neighbourhood.
The
most important
of the inscribed
slabs which are
walled up in the
crypt, is here exhibited;
it is one<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>INSCRIPTION TO SEVERUS.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
of the inscriptions
bearing the
names of the emperor Septimius Severus (who
added to his own name that of his predecessor, Pertinax),
of his eldest son, Caracalla, who styled himself
Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Pius, and of Geta,
his younger son, whose name and title have obviously
been erased from the tablet, an operation which
we find has been studiously performed on many
similar inscriptions, doubtless after his murder by
his unnatural brother Caracalla. The date of this
inscription is marked by the union of Severus and
his two sons in the imperial title. Its object does
not appear from what remains of the stone, further
than that it recorded some act done by a vexillation
of some portion of the Roman forces.</p>

<p class='c000'>The mediæval antiquities of Hexham are highly interesting.
The gateways and embattled towers will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>repay examination; but the gem of this fine old town,
which in the Saxon era was an episcopal see, is the
Abbey-church. The choir and transepts alone remain;
they exhibit much beauty of detail, and their several
parts blend most harmoniously together. The church
formerly possessed the right of sanctuary. The frid-stool
is still in its place. The cross which marked
the eastern boundary of the privileged territory is
nearly entire, and is kept near its original site, in the
yard of the poor-house. The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>disjecta membra</em></span> of that
which marked the northern boundary of the sanctuary
lie by the side of the road going over Cross-bank,
a hill between two and three miles north
of Hexham, and from which the traveller approaching
the town from the north first obtains a view
of the venerable abbey-church, and surrounding
town. The prospect is now, to the peaceful antiquary,
guiltless of his neighbour’s blood, singularly
interesting—what must it have been when descried
in ancient times by panting fugitives, pressed by an
avenging hand, and fleeing to the sanctuary! This
cross remains a monument of the disordered state
of society in the middle ages, and leads the reflecting
passenger to contrast his present tranquility with
the insecurity of former times. No favoured spot is
now necessary to shield the innocent from the rage
of a stronger assailant, or will be allowed to stay the
course of justice upon the guilty.</p>

<div class='sidenote c015'>EBCHESTER.</div>
<p class='c000'><em>EBCHESTER</em>, situated upon the line of Watling-street,
is, as its name indicates, a Roman station.
Surtees thus describes it:—</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>Ebchester stands at the foot of a long descent, yet on the
edge of a still steeper declivity. Its cottages and trees are
scattered along a lofty brow overhanging the green haugh-lands
of the Derwent. On the very edge of the steep, the vallum
of a Roman station is still extremely distinct, and the
little chapel of Ebchester, a farmhold, and a few thatched
cottages, stand within the very area of the ancient <span class='sc'>Vindomora</span>—if
<span class='sc'>Vindomora</span> it be, for the point is by no means
stated as beyond controversy.</p>

<div class='sidenote c015'>LANCHESTER.</div>
<p class='c000'><em>LANCHESTER</em> is, on the authority of the itinerary
of Richard of Cirencester, conceived to be the
<span class='sc'>Epeiacum</span> of the Romans. Though several miles
removed from the Wall, its position upon Watling-street
would render it useful as a supporting station.
It occupies a lofty brow to the west of the village, on
a tongue of land formed by the junction of two
small streams. On three sides the ground falls from
the camp; on the west only it is commanded by a
high moorland hill, whose prospect ranges from the
Cheviots, in the north, to the Cleveland hills, in the
south. The station is one of the largest class, containing
an area of about eight acres. The walls may
be distinguished on all sides. The south wall, though
deprived of its facing-stones, stands eight feet high,
and shews nine courses of thin rubble-stones arranged
edgewise in a leaning direction. A layer of
very rough mortar has been placed on each course
of stones after they have been placed in their bed.
On the outside of the south-east angle a subterranean
chamber has been discovered; the descent to it is
by steps. It is difficult to conjecture the use to
which it has been put; a similar chamber was found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>to occupy the same position outside the camp at
Plumpton. The masonry of some chambers near
the south-east corner of the station, which when first
opened were found to be full of bones, is very perfect.
The remains of a hypocaust may be seen near
to the place where the pretorium has probably stood.
Lanchester seems to have been garrisoned almost
throughout the entire period of Roman occupation;
a large proportion of the coins found at it are of the
higher empire, but the series extends down to
Valentinian. The name of Gordian occurs on two
inscriptions as the restorer of some of its buildings.
The destruction of the station was probably owing to
some sudden and violent catastrophe. The observations
of Surtees on this subject, are applicable to
many of the camps of the Barrier.</p>

<p class='c014'>The red ashes of the basilica and bath, the vitrified flooring,
and the metallic substances evidently run by fire, which occur
amongst the ruins, form a strong indication that the structure
perished in the flames.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has already been observed (p. <a href='#Page_261'>261</a>) that two
aqueducts have brought water to the station from a
distance of some miles. This is the more remarkable
as several deep wells have been found near the
camp, and there are open springs within fifty paces
from the south and east wall.</p>

<p class='c000'>The surrounding moor abounds in iron-stone; of
this the Romans seem to have availed themselves,
for immense heaps of slag, of ancient production,
have been found in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span><em>BINCHESTER</em> is still farther to the south, on
the same line of road; but, on account of its distance,
would have but little intercourse with the stations
immediately connected with the Barrier. It contains
some hypocausts, which are peculiarly worthy
of careful examination.</p>

<p class='c004'>Retracing our steps and again penetrating the region
of fierce Caledonian onslaughts and border feuds,
we find Bewcastle occupying a position north of the
Wall, on the Maiden-way, corresponding with that
which Risingham does on Watling-street.</p>

<div class='sidenote c015'>BEWCASTLE.</div>
<p class='c000'><em>BEWCASTLE</em> stands in the bottom of a basin
formed by a wide amphitheatre of bleak and lofty
hills. The camp occupies a platform slightly elevated
above the rivulet, the Kirkbeck, which washes its
southern ramparts and permeates the valley. The
northern side is the weakest part of the position, but
even here there is a depression in the contour of
the ground, which would render it more easily defensible.
In this quarter too there are marks of
artificial fortifications beyond the station wall. The
fort, in order to suit the nature of the ground, is not
of the usual square form, but is six-sided; it probably
encloses an area of about four acres. The
ground on which the camp stands is reckoned the
most fertile in all Cumberland. It was in the depth
of winter that I visited it (1, Jan. 1850) but even
then the space occupied by the fortifications might
be distinguished by its peculiar verdure. To the
east of the camp are some barrow-like mounds, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>on the west of it are terraced lines, bearing testimony
to the agricultural industry of the Romans. On the
eminence westward of the camp are the foundations
of square buildings, probably posts of observation.
On the lofty summits of some of the adjacent hills
the concentric lines of British encampments plainly
appear. They still seem to bid defiance to the
Roman fort in the valley.</p>

<p class='c000'>Within the lines of the camp, and protected by a
moat of its own, is a dark and frowning castle; it is
tersely described in an ancient manuscript, ‘as a
strength against the Scots in time of warre.’ The
captain of Bewcastle was a military chief of
considerable power; he is frequently mentioned
in Border minstrelsy. The castle is built with
the stones of the station. Its masonry is very
rude; the mortar which has been used is rough,
containing, besides gravel and sand, pieces of coal,
charcoal, burnt clay, and broken bricks. A tower,
apparently added after the main structure was reared,
guards the entrance-gateway.</p>

<p class='c000'>This, or some previous building, gives name to
Bewcastle—Bueth’s-castle.</p>

<p class='c014'>Bueth was, before the conquest, lord of Bewcastle and Gilsland.
After some previous changes, Henry II., by a grant,
dated <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘<em>apud Novum Castrum super Tynam</em>,’</span> gave the manor
of Gilsland to Hubert de Vallibus, one of his Norman retainers.
The Saxons were not men quietly to submit to wrong.
Gilbert Bueth, son of the dispossessed proprietor, collecting a
band of followers, made frequent incursions into his ancient
patrimony. Robert de Vallibus, son of Hubert, the former
possessor, suggested a conference, at which he basely assassinated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>the unarmed Saxon. Expiation was easy; the<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>ORIGIN OF LANERCOST PRIORY.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
priory of Lanercost was founded and richly endowed. It is
traditionally said that part of the expiatory ceremony consisted
in the demolition of the walls of his castle at Castle-steads
(Cambeck-fort), and sowing the site with salt. The
baronial residence was transferred to Irthington, where, as
already observed, some traces of it remain. Robert de Vallibus
was afterwards employed by Henry II. as a judge of
assize. How lax must the state of morality have been, when
a murderer was allowed to sit upon the bench! His ill-gotten
lands were not permitted to descend to his posterity, William,
his only child, dying before him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The far-famed Runic cross, respecting which so
much has been written, holds its ancient place in the
church-yard of Bewcastle. The inscription, which
is now hardly legible, is pronounced by Kemble
(Archæologia xxviii. 347) to be an Anglo-Saxon, not
a Norse one. Two Roman inscriptions, not now
to be found, have been described as belonging to
this station. One of them, which Camden saw
used as a grave-stone, bore the letters,</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c017'>
    <div>LEG[IO] II AVG[VSTA]</div>
    <div>FECIT</div>
    <div class='c001'>The second legion, the august,</div>
    <div>made <em>this</em>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The other, much fractured, Horsley saw fulfilling
the same office. He says, ‘I take it to have been an
honorary monument erected to Hadrian, by the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Legio secunda Augusta</em></span>, and the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Legio vicesima</em></span>.’</p>

<div class='sidenote c015'>WHITLEY CASTLE.</div>
<p class='c000'><em>WHITLEY CASTLE</em> is the modern name of
another outpost, which is situated on the Maiden-way,
as far south of the Wall as Bewcastle is north
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>of it. An imperfect inscription found here, and
described by Camden and Horsley, commemorates
the dedication of a temple to Caracalla, in his fourth
consulship (A.D. 213), by the third cohort of the
Nervii. As the Notitia places the third cohort of
the Nervii at <span class='sc'>Alionis</span>, it is conceived that such
may have been the ancient designation of the camp at
Whitley Castle. The station stands upon the
gently inclining side of a hill, about two miles
north of the town of Alston. The railway approaches
within a few furlongs of it. The form
of the camp is peculiar, being that of a trapezoid,
whereas the usual figure is that of a parallelogram.
In another respect it differs from all the other camps
that we have hitherto examined; it is surrounded by
an extraordinary number of earthen entrenchments.
On the western side, which is the most exposed,
there are no fewer than seven ditches, with corresponding
ramparts, and on the north, four. These
earth-works are in a state of wonderful preservation.
The strength of these lines, and the comparative
absence, both within and without the station,
of Roman stones, render it probable that the
garrison trusted to breastworks of earth, rather
than of masonry. The general level of the camp
is elevated above the surface of the contiguous
ground, in consequence, probably, of the mass of
ruins which it contains. Its whole area, including
the entrenchments and ditches, amounts to nine acres.</p>

<p class='c000'>A large altar procured from the station is in the
neighbouring farm house; the inscription is illegible,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>but it has on the upper part of its four sides, a
carving in bold relief.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>ROMAN DUNGHILL.</div>

<p class='c000'>It is no unusual thing to find in the neighbourhood
of a Roman station manifest traces of the dunghill
of the fort. As might be expected, such a
repository is replete with objects which, though once
despised and cast away as worthless, well repay the
search of the antiquary. Not far from the north-east
angle of this camp a large dunghill was found,
which has been recently removed for farm purposes.
It contained numerous fragments of Roman earthenware
and glass, as well as armillæ of jet or fine cannel
coal. Its most curious product, however, was a
large store of old shoes or sandals. The soles were
all made ‘right and left,’ and consisted of several folds
of leather fastened together with round-headed nails.
(See <a href='#p444h'>Plate XVIII</a>. figs. 3, 4, 5.) Were this the only
place where these curious objects have been found,
we might hesitate to assign to them a primeval date,
but very many having been discovered in digging
the foundations of Carlisle gaol, and some in clearing
the buildings at <span class='sc'>Cilurnum</span>, as well as other places,
and being accompanied in every instance by other
articles of undoubted Roman manufacture, we are
entitled to consider them as the produce of Roman
hands. Modern artists might examine them
with advantage; Roman shoe-makers thought it no
dishonour to let nature prescribe the form that their
handy-work should assume.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>WALLIS’S ENTHUSIASM.</div>

<p class='c000'>Wallis, the author of the Natural History and
Antiquities of Northumberland, was born within the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>ramparts of this camp; the house is now removed.
In the preface to his work he accounts for the antiquarian
bias of his mind in the following strain:—</p>

<p class='c014'>Northumberland being Roman ground, and receiving my
first breath in one of their <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>castra</em></span>, I was led by a sort of enthusiasm
to an inquiry and search after their towns, their
cities, and temples, their baths, their altars, their <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>tumuli</em></span>,
their military ways, and other remains of their splendour and
magnificence; which will admit of a thousand views and reviews,
and still give pleasure to such as have a gust for any
thing Roman; every year almost presenting new discoveries
of the wisdom, the contrivance, ingenuity, and elegance of that
respectable people.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although nearly a century has elapsed since
Wallis wrote this, the field of Romano-British antiquities
still retains much of the fertility he ascribes
to it, and doubtless, has stores yet in reserve for
the assiduous inquirer.</p>

<p class='c004'>Before proceeding to the stations which supported
the western extremity of the Wall, there are two
camps, one to the east, and another to the west of the
Maiden-way, which demand a little of our attention.</p>

<p class='c004'><em>OLD TOWN.</em>—Horsley entertained the idea that
he had found the remains of a Roman camp at Old
Town, near Catton Beacon, in Allendale. Hodgson
treats the opinion with some degree of ridicule. I
am disposed to think that Horsley is right, though
the inquiries I made on the spot did not lead me
to a decision of the question.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>STATION NEAR BRAMPTON.</div>

<p class='c000'><em>BRAMPTON.</em>—About a mile west of the modern
town of Brampton, upon a gentle eminence commanding
a view in every direction of a most beautiful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>country, are the traces of a small Roman camp.
The father of English topography, guided in some
measure by the similarity of the names, fixed the ancient
<span class='sc'>Bremetenracum</span> at Brampton; but Horsley,
in consequence of the absence of Roman remains,
demurred to the correctness of the conclusion. It
is not surprising that this camp escaped the attention
of Horsley, as it is situated within the ancient
park of Brampton, considerable portions of which
were, a century ago, covered with tangled brushwood
and venerable forest trees. Its trenches, though
still visible, are fast disappearing; every time it
is ploughed, the furrow is turned into the hollow
of its fosse. Though hundreds of cart-loads of
stones have been taken from it, the ground on
which the camp stood is thickly strewed with stony
fragments. On walking over the spot, I picked up
a piece of dove-coloured pottery, part of a millstone,
and several portions of Roman tile. Besides individual
coins which have occasionally been found
here, an earthen jar, containing a large hoard, was
turned up by the plough in 1826. It contained not
fewer than five thousand pieces, all of them of the
lower empire.</p>

<p class='c000'>If Whitley Castle be the <span class='sc'>Alionis</span> of the Notitia,
this, as coming next in order, may be, as Camden
conjectured, <span class='sc'>Bremetenracum</span>.<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c012'><sup>[131]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>ANCIENT TUMULI.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>In the plain to the south of the camp, are some remarkable
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>tumuli</em></span>. One mound of large dimensions,
standing alone, is covered with oak trees. Three
others of small size, and close to each other, are at the
eastern extremity of the same field. Two of them
are circular, and about twelve yards in diameter; the
third is elongated, and measures about thirty-two
yards in length. Whatever opinion we may form
respecting the larger mound, there can be no doubt
that the smaller ones are artificial barrows; the hollow
made by the excavation of the soil for their formation
is discernible. They do not appear to have been
opened, but will no doubt soon yield up their long-hoarded
treasures to some enterprising antiquary.</p>

<p class='c000'>Between the station and the town of Brampton,
may be noticed the faint traces of an earthen encampment
of the usual Roman form; it is fast disappearing
under the action of the plough. West of the
station, stands an ancient church, formed of Roman
stones. Though the living have forsaken the venerable
pile, the dead are still being laid in its church-yard.</p>

<p class='c004'>We now approach the stations which supported
the Barrier near its western extremity; it will be
well to examine first those north of the Wall.</p>

<div class='sidenote c015'>CAMP AT NETHERBY.</div>
<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span><em>NETHERBY.</em>—The nucleus of the seat of sir
James Graham is a border tower, with walls of great
thickness. These walls were doubtless erected at the
expense of the ramparts and buildings of the camp,
within which the mansion is situated. The form of
the station cannot now be satisfactorily defined;
but the number and importance of the coins, altars,
and sculptures, which have been found within it,
prove that it was a place of consequence during
the period of Roman occupation. The site, though
not greatly elevated, commands an extensive prospect
in every direction. The bank on its western
side, which slopes down to the valley of the
Esk, is said to have been washed in ancient days
by the waters of the Solway.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the many important inscriptions discovered
here, is one to Hadrian, closely resembling those
which have been found at Milking-gap, Bradley, and
other places. The stone has long been lost, but
in Gough’s Camden the inscription is given thus—</p>

<div class='sidenote'>SCULPTURE AT NETHERBY.</div>

<p class='c000'>Some very fine sculptured stones, found in the
station, are preserved on the spot. Amongst them
is one which is figured on the adjoining page. A
youth stands in a niche, a mural crown is on his
head, a cornucopia in his left hand, and a patera,
from which he pours out a libation on an altar, in
his right; it is one of the finest carvings that is to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>be met with on the line of the Wall. From the
grooves which are cut in the lower part of the stone,
<span id='p353' class='figleft id013'><img src='images/i_p353.jpg' alt='Genius of the Wall' class='ig001' /></span>we may naturally conclude,
that the figure
has been formerly set
in masonry, perhaps
to adorn the approach
to some temple. Gordon
supposes the figure
to be intended
for Hadrian; Lysons
thinks that it was
meant for the ‘Genius
of the Wall of Severus’—let
us combine
the two ideas, and
suppose, that the figure
is that of Hadrian,
representing, as he
had the best right to
do, ‘the Genius of the
Barrier.’</p>

<p class='c000'>Reference will afterwards
be made to the
figures of the <em>Deæ Matres</em>
which have been
found here.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>BLATUM BULGIUM.</div>

<p class='c000'>Netherby is supposed
to be the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='sc'>Castra

of the second Antonine ‘Iter,’ which was garrisoned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>by a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>numerus exploratorum</em></span>. Its situation
is very suitable for an exploratory garrison; and its
distance from Carlisle on the one hand, and Middleby
on the other, nearly corresponds with the distance
at which it is set down in the Itinerary both from
<span class='sc'>Luguvallium</span> and <span class='sc'>Blatum Bulgium</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote c015'>CAMP NEAR MIDDLEBY.</div>
<p class='c000'><em>MIDDLEBY.</em>—To the south of Middleby Kirk, in
the county of Dumfries, is a camp which is called in
the district Burns, or Birrens. It occupies a low
and sheltered situation, but possesses, notwithstanding,
considerable natural capabilities of defence.
The water of Mein washes the earthy scar which
forms its southern margin, and the Middleby burn,
which joins the Mein at the south-east angle of the
camp, runs parallel to its eastern rampart. It appears,
from the plan given in Roy’s Military Antiquities,
to have been protected, in addition to its
stone walls, on three sides by four earthen ramparts,
with intervening ditches; and on the north, which
was at once by nature the weakest, and the quarter
most exposed to the attack of the enemy, by not
fewer than six. The northern ramparts remain in
nearly their original completeness, but the overflowings
of the Mein on the south, the construction of a
road on the east, and the operations of agriculture on
the west, have destroyed the ramparts on these sides.
A <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>procestrium</em></span>, or out-work, protected by its own ramparts,
appears to have been appended to the west side
of the original camp; or, perhaps, to speak more correctly,
the suburban buildings, which were situated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>in this quarter were embraced by an additional fortification.
In so exposed a situation, such a precaution
would be highly proper. The field in which the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>procestrium</em></span> was, has been brought into cultivation,
and a great number of carved stones, which were
found in it, taken to Hoddam Castle. The corners
of the camp are, as is usually the case, rounded; the
four gateways are clearly discernible. The interior
area of the station measures three acres and three-quarters.
On the south side of the station a large
vault, arched with stone, was laid open more than a
century ago. Popular credulity has magnified it into
an underground passage, which extended all the way
to Burnswark; the people in the neighbourhood aver
that they have known persons go a considerable way
along it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The altars and sculptures found at this place are
engraved and described, apparently with great
accuracy, in Stuart’s Caledonia Romana. Amongst
them is a stone tablet, bearing the words—</p>

<p class='c000'>The lamented author of this work says—</p>

<p class='c014'>With the exception of a brass coin of Germanicus, and the
inscription containing the name of Hadrian, the greater part,
if not all the antiquities found at Birrens, may be ascribed perhaps
to the third or fourth century. The striking similarity
of style and execution which exists between them and the
bulk of those discovered in the north of England, of which
the dates can be ascertained, is sufficient to stamp them as
the productions of a period subsequent to the reign of Septimius
Severus.—<cite>Caledonia Romana</cite>, 130.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>It did not belong to the author’s subject; to inquire,
how the fact of so few of the memorials of the
mural line being of the age of Severus, comported
with the popular idea that he built the Wall!</p>

<div class='sidenote c015'>BURNSWARK HILL.</div>

<p class='c000'><em>BURNSWARK</em>, or Birrenswork.—A solitary
hill, nearly three miles to the north-west of Middleby,
rises to the height of nearly seven hundred and forty
feet above the level of the sea. 'On its top lies an
unequal plain, about nine hundred feet long, by four
hundred and fifty of mean width—almost inaccessible
on two of its sides, and by no means of easy attainment
on any.'<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c012'><sup>[132]</sup></a> From this elevated summit, the
mountain ridges which are scattered over not fewer
than six of the Scottish counties can be descried;
looking eastward, the Nine-nicks of Thirlwall are in
sight; southward, the familiar forms of Skiddaw,
Saddleback, and Cross-fell rise into view; to the
south-west, the craggy peaks of the Isle of Man
arrest the attention in favourable states of the atmosphere;
and, not unfrequently a long, black streak, on
the distant verge of the ocean, indicates the position
of Ireland. According to the former political divisions
of the British empire, four kingdoms were thus
to be seen from Burnswark-hill.</p>

<p class='c000'>So commanding a position was not neglected by
the ancient Britons. 'Around the area of the summit
may still be traced the remains of a wall, composed
of earth and stones, which seems to have been
raised at every spot where the precipitous rock did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>not of itself afford sufficient protection.' Unhappily
most of the stones have been hurled into the valley
below, to form a long boundary fence. The enclosure
is divided into two compartments of nearly equal size;
one of them contains a circular range of stones, the
remains apparently of an ancient cairn or watch-tower.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>CAMPS ON THE HILL.</div>

<p class='c000'>On two of the sides of Burnswark are the vestiges
of Roman military works. The largest, which is on
the southern slope, encloses an area of twelve acres.
It has been originally encompassed by two ramparts,
separated, as usual, by a deep trench; it had three
gates on the upper, and apparently the same number
on the under side, with a single one at each
end. These gateways have been protected by circular
mounds, thrown up before them, and fortified
on the top. The pretorium, or general’s quarters,
defended by an entrenchment of its own, was placed
on the north-west angle of the camp. This circumstance
would seem to warrant us in supposing,
that, even in the stationary camps of the Wall, the
pretorium was not uniformly placed in the upper
part of the central area, where, according to the
usual theory, we should expect to find it. All the
entrenchments are of earth, and on the north side
they are peculiarly bold.</p>

<p class='c000'>The camp on the northern face of the hill has been
constructed upon the same principle, but is in a less
perfect condition. It is of the same length, but has
only half its breadth. A covered way conducts from
the one to the other. It is probable that both these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>camps have been the summer quarters, <em>castra
æstiva</em>, of the garrison at Middleby. So important
a position would not, however, at any period of the
year be abandoned to the enemy; 'when not filled with
the tents of its summer inhabitants, it is probable
that a small garrison was maintained on its summit.'<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c012'><sup>[133]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote c015'>CAMP AT PLUMPTON.</div>
<p class='c000'><em>PLUMPTON.</em>—Several camps south of the line,
and at nearly equal distances from the Wall and from
one another, added security to the fortification in the
western district. Plumpton, or Old Penrith, called in
the locality by the common name of Castlesteads,
is a large station about thirteen miles south of
Carlisle. The conjecture of Horsley ascribed to it, the
name of <span class='sc'>Bremetenracum</span>. The turnpike-road
goes close past it, as did the ancient Roman way
which led from <span class='sc'>Luguvallium</span> to the south of
Britain. The station presents the usual characteristics
of a Roman camp. Though not much elevated,
it is sufficiently raised to enjoy a most extensive
view of the surrounding country. The western
side is the strongest, being protected by the deep
but narrow valley in which the river Peterel flows.
Its ramparts are boldly marked, and the interior of
the station is filled up to their level by a mass of
prostrate habitations. The largest heap of ruins is
on the north-east quarter; it may be the remains of
the pretorium. The fosse is well defined on the
north, south, and west sides. Enough of the eastern
gate remains to shew that it has been a double portal.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>One stone of the threshold yet retains its
position; it is worn by the feet of the ancient
tenants of the city, and is circularly chafed by the
action of the door in opening and shutting. Several
very large stones, which have been used in the construction
of the south gateway, lie near their original
site—some of them yet exhibit the holes in which
the pivots of the doors turned. The line of the
street, which went from the eastern to the western
gateway (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>via principalis</em></span>), is discernible. On the
outside of the south-east corner of the station, an
arched chamber, or passage, was discovered a few
years ago; but it is now filled up with rubbish.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>OLD PENRITH.</div>

<p class='c000'>Extensive remains of ancient foundations have
been removed from the field on the east of the station;
here, according to tradition, Old Penrith stood.
There are also indications of suburban buildings to
the west of the station. In the neighbourhood of the
camp, and even at some distance from it, we meet, in
the houses and stone fences, with such a number of
the small neat stones which were usually employed
in the construction of Roman dwellings, as to impress
us with the idea, that the suburban buildings were
very extensive in every direction.</p>

<p class='c000'>In recently lowering a part of the turnpike-road,
about a quarter of a mile south of the station, a well,
cased with Roman masonry, was exposed. It is
square, and is set diagonally to the road; it now copiously
supplies the neighbouring farm-houses,
which formerly were, in dry seasons, much inconvenienced
by the scarcity of water.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>Several sculptured, and inscribed stones, as well
as coins, have been found here; but none of them
are of a nature sufficiently interesting to detain us
longer at Plumpton.</p>

<div class='sidenote c015'>OLD CARLISLE.</div>
<p class='c000'><em>OLD CARLISLE</em> is nearly two miles south of
Wigton. The station is a large one; the ruins of
its ramparts and interior buildings are boldly
marked. A double ditch, with intervening vallum,
seems to have surrounded the fort. The rivulet
Wiza runs in a deep ravine immediately below the station,
on its west side, and at a remoter distance, on its
south also, thereby lending to it additional strength.
<span id='p360' class='figleft id035'><img src='images/i_p360.jpg' alt='Altar to Jupiter for the safety of Severus' class='ig001' /></span>The remains of suburban buildings may still be seen
outside the walls, on the south, east, and west.
Within the fort, a street may be
distinctly traced from the north
to the south gate, and another
from the east towards the west.
Near the centre of the station
is a moist spot of ground where
we may conceive a well to have
been. Up to a recent period,
the Roman roads leading from
this station on the one hand,
to Carlisle, and on the other
to Maryport, were distinctly
visible. Of the many important
inscribed stones dug out
of this station, that which is represented above is
probably the most interesting. It was found in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>year 1775, about two hundred yards east of the
camp, and is now in the collection at Netherby.</p>

<div class='sidenote c015'>CAMP NEAR MARYPORT.</div>
<p class='c000'><em>MARYPORT.</em>—On the cliffs overhanging the
modern town of Maryport, are the manifest remains
of a large Roman station. Its position gives it a
commanding view of the Solway Firth and Irish
Channel. The camp is a very large one, and the
lines of its ramparts are very boldly developed. The
eastern side, which is the only one that is not defended
by a natural defile, or valley, was protected
by a double ditch. There are some traces of masonry
also near the gateway on this side, which render
it probable that this entrance had been guarded
by additional outworks. Some portions of this gateway
remain; the sill of it is strongly marked by the
action of chariot wheels. The ruts are about
five inches deep, and five feet ten inches apart.
Within the station is a well, encased with circular
masonry. The interior of the station was excavated
in 1766. The following account of the appearances
which were then observed, is given in Lysons’ Cumberland:—</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>The workmen found the arch of the gate beat violently
down and broken; and on entering the great street, discovered
evident marks of the houses having been more than once
burnt to the ground and rebuilt; an event not unlikely to have
happened on so exposed a frontier. The streets had been
paved with broad flag-stones, much worn by use, particularly
the steps into a vaulted room, supposed to have been a temple.
The houses had been roofed by Scotch slates, which, with the
pegs which fastened them, lay confusedly in the streets. Glass
vessels, and even mirrors were found; and coals had evidently
been used in the fire places. Foundations of buildings were
round the fort on all sides.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>HOSPITAL CAMP.</div>

<p class='c000'>In the grounds of Nether Hall, the seat of
J. Pocklington Senhouse, esq., is a small entrenchment
containing an area of about an acre and a
half; it is in a low and sheltered position, and has
probably been a retreat for invalids. Ancient
roads have diverged from this station, leading to
Bowness, Wigton, and Papcastle. On draining,
lately, the fields on the line of road leading towards
Old Carlisle, its pavement was met with,
and to a great extent removed. The body of
the road was composed of large granite boulders,
some of them a quarter of a ton in weight; the
interstices being filled up with smaller stones. On
the south side of this way several slabs of stone
were found, lying flat on the ground. They probably
covered the ashes of the dead; fragments of red
pottery and glass were found beneath them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>ANTIQUITIES AT NETHER HALL.</div>

<p class='c000'>Very numerous and very important are the remains
of antiquity which this station has yielded.
With the exception of one fine altar, they are all
carefully preserved in the house and grounds at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>Nether Hall. Many of the sculptured stones which
have been found here, are more highly carved and
more tastefully designed than is usual in the mural
region. An altar to the genius of the place, which
has been removed to Whitehaven Castle, and will be
described in the last Part of this work, is characterized
by Camden as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘<em>ara pulcherrima affabrè artificio
antiquo exculpta</em>,’</span> and a more graceful altar
than that which is shewn in this cut, we have not
met with in our mural peregrination. It is important,
also, as proving the residence here of the
'<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>prima cohors Hispanorum</em></span>.' In consequence, probably,
of some service done to Hadrian this cohort
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>seems, subsequently to the dedication of this altar, to
have obtained the title of Ælia and the rank of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>milliaria

<p class='c000'>A plain, square, but now partially fractured, pillar,
inscribed, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='fss'>ROMAE AETERNAE ET FORTVNAE REDVCI</span></span>, is
reserved to form the concluding cut on the last page
of this volume. It is a striking memorial at once of
the aspiring pretensions and blighted prospects of
the imperial city. A boar, the symbol of the
twentieth legion, exhibiting more than the usual
spirit, forms the vignette at the close of this Part;
and the slab which bears testimony to the labours
which the second, and twentieth, legion underwent in
constructing the works of this station, is introduced
at the close of the Part devoted to the discussion of
the question ‘Who built the Wall?’ There is preserved
in the piazza at Nether Hall, a carving in
relief of a warrior on horseback trampling on a fallen
enemy; the drawing is not strictly correct, but
is very spirited, and the foreshortening of the horse’s
head remarkably good. Besides these, there are
several large and instructive altars and funereal
slabs, as well as a tablet having a Greek inscription
to this effect—Aulus Egnatius Pastor set up this
to Æsculapius.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>The minor antiquities consist of fragments of tiles,
one of which bears the stamp of the first cohort of
the Spaniards, a bronze pot bearing a marked resemblance
to some which are in modern use, several
earthenware vessels of large size, and quite perfect,
implements of iron, and weapons of war. Amongst
the coins which have been found in the station,
are a great many forged denarii of Trajan and
Hadrian. They are chiefly formed of lead, and
are badly made; in some instances the metal has
not reached the centre of the mould, and in scarcely
any have the edges of the casting been properly
dressed. Genuine coin must have been exceedingly
scarce among the soldiery of the camp, and
their credulity very great, to allow of the circulation
of such base imitations.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>ANCIENT BARROW.</div>

<p class='c000'>A large artificial mound or barrow is to the
left of the station. The inhabitants had an old tradition
respecting it; they conceived it to be the
sepulchre of a king. It was opened in 1763; near
its centre ‘the pole and shank bones of an ox’ were
found, but neither urns, burnt bones, nor coins, were
discovered.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is great uncertainty about the ancient name
of this fort. Camden pronounced it to be <span class='sc'>Olenacum</span>,
chiefly influenced by the resemblance in
sound between it and the name of the neighbouring
village of Ellenborough (Maryport is but of recent
origin). This supposition gathers force from the fact
that in ancient documents the river Ellen, which gives
name to the place, is written ‘Alne’ and ‘Olne.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span><em>PAPCASTLE</em> is about six miles south-east of
Maryport. Numerous relics of antiquity have been
found here, but little now remains to mark it out as
the site of a Roman station except its extraordinary
fertility. The town of Cockermouth, a mile to the
south of the fort, is supposed to have risen from its
ruins.</p>

<p class='c000'>The forts which we have already examined may
be thought sufficient to support the line of the Wall.
The peculiar circumstances of its western extremity
will perhaps justify us in reckoning Moresby,
notwithstanding its distance from the Wall, among
the out-stations of the Barrier. Not only does the
Scottish coast, by projecting considerably beyond the
western termination of the Wall, facilitate the invasion
of the intra-mural portion of the island—but Ireland,
the native land of the Scoto-Celts, is nigh at
hand. It was necessary to prevent, not only the
inhabitants of Caledonia landing on the coast of
Cumberland, but the ‘Scots,’ also, who at that time
‘poured out of Ireland.’ Another sea-port station,
south of Maryport, was therefore requisite.</p>

<div class='sidenote c015'>CAMP AT MORESBY.</div>
<p class='c000'><em>MORESBY</em>, within a short distance of Whitehaven,
still exhibits the remains of a Roman camp.
It occupies a commanding position, enjoying especially
an extensive marine prospect. Its western
and southern ramparts are still good. The parish
church and church-yard border upon its eastern
wall. A sculptured stone, evidently chiselled by
Roman hands, lies upon the spot, under the ruined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>chancel-arch of the old church. The important slab,
of which the wood-cut gives a representation, was
found in digging for the foundations of the present
parish church. It is another of the interesting testimonies
which
we have of the
energy and influence
of the
emperor Hadrian
in those
parts. Like the
Milking-gap
inscription, it
gives the name
of the emperor
in the genitive case.</p>

<div id='p367'  class='figcenter id023'>
<img src='images/i_p367.jpg' alt='Slab to Hadrian, Moresby' class='ig001' />
</div>

<div class='sidenote'>FORT AT MALBRAY.</div>
<p class='c000'>A military way ran along the coast from this station,
by way of Maryport, to the extremity of the
Wall, at Bowness. By this means, the defence of
the coast could be more effectually secured. As the
distance between Maryport and Bowness is considerable,
a small camp was planted at Malbray,
which is about midway between the two places. The
site of it is now a ploughed field.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have now taken a hasty review of the stations
on both sides of the Wall, which have supported that
structure. Never, assuredly, was a dangerous frontier
more securely guarded. So long as the stations were
supplied with vigilant and well-disciplined troops, no
foe, however well armed, could successfully attempt
the passage of the Barrier of the Lower Isthmus.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>MURAL SCENES.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>Even the cursory view that we have taken of the
subject, entitles us to say, that the boldness of the design
was worthy of Rome in the zenith of her glory;
and that the manner in which the project was carried
out was becoming a nation with whom to conceive
was to execute.</p>

<p class='c000'>If we turn our attention for a moment from the
work, to the object for which it was intended, regret,
that man should use his ingenuity for the purposes
of aggression and bloodshed, will take the place of
admiration. Milton aptly describes the scenes which
this region would often witness:—</p>

Our course hitherto has been a detail
of facts; now we enter upon the
region of speculation. In the
former Parts of this work, the
history of the Roman occupation
of Britain has been briefly
told and an attempt made to depict
the present condition of the
Vallum and Wall, with their camps,
castles, and outworks; now the question
must be put—Is the Barrier the
Work of one master-mind, or are its several
parts the productions of different periods, and of
different persons? Had the statements of the ancient
historians upon the subject been explicit and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>consistent, the inquiry would involve simply an
appeal to their authority; unhappily, the information
which they afford is not only very meagre, but
of a character so unsatisfactory, as to compel us to
sift their evidence, and to compare it with the facts
which we glean from an examination of the fortifications
themselves.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>AGRICOLA’S WORKS.</div>

<p class='c000'>Agricola, we are informed by Tacitus, erected forts
both on the Lower and Upper Isthmus; we are nowhere
told that he drew walls, whether of earth or
stone, across either of them. The northern rampart
of the Vallum has by many been conceived to be
the work of Agricola. In the absence of any direct
historical testimony bearing upon this subject, the
circumstance that the lines of the Vallum pursue a
course precisely parallel to each other, must be
considered as fatal to this theory. It is altogether
incredible, that two engineers should at different
periods construct independent works, without crossing
each other’s ramparts. In Roy’s Military Antiquities,
several instances are given where the
trenches of one encampment cut arbitrarily those of
another, the troops who last occupied the post, not
seeming to pay the least attention to the works of
their predecessors; the lines of the Vallum would
doubtless exhibit the same appearance had they
been the works of different periods. The claims
of Agricola to the authorship of any part of the
Vallum may therefore at once be set aside, and the
inquiry be confined to the relative claims of Hadrian
and Severus.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>HADRIAN AND SEVERUS.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>If the parallelism of the lines of the Vallum be
fatal to the theory, that one of the mounds is the work
of Agricola, and the others the work of Hadrian, a
similar mode of reasoning leads to the conclusion,
that the Vallum and the Wall cannot be independent
structures. If Severus, finding that the earth-works
of Hadrian had fallen into decay, or were no longer
sufficient to wall out the Caledonians, had determined
to erect a more formidable Barrier, would he not
have mapped out its track without any reference to
the former ruinous and inefficient erection?
Had he done so, we should find the lines taking
independent courses—sometimes contiguous, occasionally
crossing each other; sometimes widely
separated, seldom pursuing for any distance a
parallel course, but the Wall, as the latest built,
uniformly seizing the strongest points, whether previously
occupied by the Vallum or not. This, however,
is not the case; the Wall and Vallum, in
crossing the island, pursue precisely the same track
from sea to sea; for the most part they are in close
companionship, and in no instance does the Wall
cut in upon the trenches of the Vallum. At the first
view of the subject, therefore, we should be disposed
to question the accuracy of the opinion which
gives to these works distinct dates, and ascribes the
Vallum to Hadrian, and the stone Wall to Severus.
Before further prosecuting this inquiry, it will be
well to lay before the reader all the statements of
the ancient historians upon the matter in question;
he will by this means see the necessity of appealing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>to the structures themselves for a satisfactory
decision of the question.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>TESTIMONY OF HISTORIANS.</div>

<p class='c000'>Herodian was contemporary with Severus, and
professes to have been an eye-witness of all that he
relates. He gives a detailed account of the emperor’s
proceedings in Britain, but does not once
mention the Wall. Dion Cassius was also contemporary
with Severus. As before observed, that
part of the original work which treats of Britain is
lost; we have, however, Xiphiline’s abridgment
of it. The only reference which he makes to the
Wall, comports with its existence previous to the arrival
of Severus in Britain, Speaking of that emperor’s
expedition against the Caledonians, he says—</p>

<p class='c014'>Nor did he ever return from this expedition, but died three
years after he first set out from Rome. He got a prodigious
mass of riches in Britain. The two most considerable bodies
of people in that island, and to which almost all the rest relate,
are the Caledonians and the Meatæ. <em>The latter dwell
near the Barrier Wall</em> (οιχουσι δε οἱ μεν Μαιαται προς αυτῳ τῳ
διατειχισματι, ὁ την νῆσον διχῆ τεμνει) <em>which divides the island into
two parts</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Spartian, writing about A.D. 280, is the first person
who gives us any direct information about the
erection of a Wall; and it is on his testimony
chiefly that the credit of the work has been given to
Severus. Speaking of Hadrian, he says—</p>

<p class='c014'>He went to Britain where he corrected many things, and
first drew a Wall (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>murumque primus duxit</em></span>) eighty miles long,
to separate the Romans from the barbarians.</p>

<p class='c000'>No testimony could be more explicit than this in
favour of the view that Hadrian built the Wall. As
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>this writer, however, subsequently ascribes the work
to Severus, many are of opinion that Spartian here
speaks of the Vallum, not of the stone Wall. Mere
verbal criticism will not decide the point, but it may
be observed in passing, that although the words
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>murus</em></span> and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>vallum</em></span> are occasionally interchanged by
Latin authors, the term (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>murus</em></span>) which Spartian
uses in the passage, taken strictly, means a stone
wall. Speaking of Severus, the same writer says—</p>

<p class='c014'>He fortified Britain with a Wall drawn (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>muro ducto</em></span>) across
the island, and ending on each side at the sea, which was the
chief glory of his reign, and for which he received the name
of Britannicus.</p>

<p class='c000'>The same writer, in a subsequent chapter, makes
a second reference to the Wall, which is of some
importance in discussing the question. Narrating an
incident which occurred near the Wall, he says—</p>

<p class='c014'>After the Wall or Vallum in Britain was completed, and
the emperor was returning to the next stage <em>not as conqueror
only, but as founder of eternal peace</em>, and was thinking within
himself what omen might happen to him, an Ethiopian soldier,
famous as a mimic, and noted for his jokes, crossed his path,
crowned with cypress. Struck with the colour of the man, and
his crown, he was angry with him, and ordered him to be put
out of his sight, when the fellow is reported, by way of a joke,
to have said—'Thou hast been everything—conquered everything:
now conqueror, be a god!'</p>

<p class='c000'>Julius Capitolinus, a writer who flourished about
the same time as Spartian (A.D. 280) speaking of
the Antonine Wall, uses an expression which seems
to imply, that the only previously existing Barrier
was one of turf. He says—</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>Antoninus, by his legate Lollius Urbicus, conquered the
Britons, the barbarians being secluded by <em>another</em> earthen
wall (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>alio muro cespiticio ducto</em></span>).</p>

<p class='c000'>All the remaining classical historians sum up in
favour of Severus; they, however, probably only re-echo
the statements of Spartian, with a slight addition
of errors of their own. Eusebius Pamphilius
says, that—</p>

<p class='c014'>Clodius Albinus being slain at Lyons, Severus made war
upon the Britons, and in order to render the subject provinces
more secure from barbaric invasion, he drew a Wall from sea
to sea, an hundred and thirty-two miles long.</p>

<p class='c000'>Aurelius Victor, who wrote about A.D. 360, recording
his great exploits, says—</p>

<p class='c014'>He achieved greater things than those, for after repulsing
the enemy in Britain, he drew a Wall from sea to sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>The younger Victor, in his epitome of the work
of the elder, says—</p>

<p class='c014'>He drew a Vallum thirty-two miles long from sea to sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>Eutropius wrote about the year 360. He says—</p>

<p class='c014'>Severus’s last war was in Britain; he drew a Wall of
thirty-two miles from sea to sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>Paulus Orosius, who wrote A.D. 417, says, that
the conqueror Severus—</p>

<p class='c014'>Having fought many severe battles, determined to separate
the part of the island which he had recovered, from the tribes
that remained unsubdued, and, therefore, drew a deep fosse,
and a very strong Vallum (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>magnam fossam firmissimumque
vallum</em></span>), strengthened with numerous towers, from sea to sea,
over a space of one hundred and thirty-two miles.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>Cassiodorus, who wrote A.D. 520, gives a similar
testimony. Among the events of the consulship of
Aper and Maximus (A.D. 207), he enumerates the
transference of the war by Severus to Britain—</p>

<p class='c014'>Where, that he might render the subject provinces more
secure against the incursions of the barbarians, he drew a
Wall (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>vallum</em></span>) from sea to sea, one hundred and thirty-two
miles in length.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>VALUE OF THEIR TESTIMONY.</div>

<p class='c000'>Such are the statements of the Roman historians
respecting the authorship of the Wall. Several circumstances
tend to invalidate the claim which they
make in behalf of Severus. The first author who attributes
the Wall to Severus is Spartian, a weak
writer, who lived in an ignorant age, and nearly a
century after the time of Severus. Surely his assertion
will not be allowed to outweigh the negative
testimony of Herodian and Dion Cassius, the contemporaries
of Septimius Severus. Of all the authors
who mention the length of the Wall, the only one
who approaches correctness is Spartian, when speaking
of the Wall, which he states that Hadrian drew
from sea to sea; eighty Roman miles is very nearly
the true length. The other writers call it thirty-two,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>SPARTIAN INCONSISTENT.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>or one hundred and thirty-two. Admitting, as some
have supposed, that the larger number is an error,
occasioned by some careless transcriber’s inserting
in the copies the centurial number (C), which did
not exist in the original, the difficulty is not removed.
Thirty-two Roman miles is the length of the Barrier
of the Upper Isthmus, not of the Lower, and these
writers seem to have confounded the one with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>other. Buchanan, Usher, and several writers, who
were as capable of weighing the evidence furnished
by the ancient historians as we are, have accordingly
maintained, that the Wall which extended from the
Forth to the Clyde, is that which was reared by
Severus. This opinion we now know, from the inscriptions
found upon it, to be erroneous; but the fact
that it was entertained by such able scholars, proves
the incompleteness of the historic evidence upon the
subject. Milton correctly estimates the vague nature
of this testimony. He writes—</p>

<p class='c014'>Severus, on the frontiers of what he had firmly conquered,
builds a wall across the island from sea to sea; which our
author judges the most magnificent of all his other deeds; and
that he thence received the style of Britannicus; in length a
hundred and thirty-two miles. Orosius adds, it is fortified
with a deep trench, and between certain spaces many towers
or battlements. The place whereof, some will have to be in
Scotland, the same which Lollius Urbicus had walled before.
Others affirm it only Hadrian’s work re-edified; both plead
authorities, and the ancient track, yet visible: but this I
leave, among the studious of these antiquities, to be discussed
more at large.—(<cite>History of England</cite>, <em>bk.</em> ii.)</p>

<p class='c000'>Spartian, moreover, invalidates his own testimony
when he says, that the erection of this Wall was the
greatest glory of Severus’s reign (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>quod maximum ejus
imperii decus est</em></span>). The Wall is indeed a magnificent
work; it is, as Stukely characterizes it, ‘the
noblest monument’ of Roman power ‘in Europe;’
but if reared by Severus, it is, a lasting monument of
his failure. He came to Britain panting for renown—he
resolved to reduce the whole island to his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>subjection—to make the sea-girt cliffs of Northern
Caledonia his barrier. The efforts which he put
forth were worthy of his resolve—‘In a word,’ says
Dion Cassius, ‘Severus lost fifty thousand men there,
and yet quitted not his enterprise.’ Were the abandonment
of the Wall of Antonine, and the withdrawal
of the frontier to the southern Isthmus, where
Hadrian, eighty years before, had prudently fixed it,
the glorious results of all his aspirations? Spartian
assuredly errs, if not in saying that Severus built the
Wall, at least in stating that this was the great boast
of his reign.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>OCCUPATIONS OF SEVERUS.</div>

<p class='c000'>When, too, we may ask, did he build the Wall?
not assuredly when he issued forth on the expedition
that was to win him so much renown, and which occupied
him the greater part of the time he was in
Britain. He was then bent upon aggression, not
defence. Neither is it probable that he would do it
on his return. According to Spartian, he had at that
time proved himself not only victorious, but the
founder of eternal peace, and thus had removed all
ground for apprehension in the direction of Caledonia.
Or, on the other hand, according to the more
accurate and trustworthy historians, Herodian and
Dion Cassius, he was returning worn out with disease
and the endless fatigues he had sustained;
chagrined at the havoc which the islanders had made
in his army, though they uniformly refused to hazard
a general engagement; and broken-hearted at the
misconduct and ingratitude of his sons, and so would,
we may suppose, have been deficient in the spirit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>and the means to embark in so large a work. That
he should have repaired some of the stations, particularly
those upon the line of his march, when about
to enter upon what he hoped to be the crowning
enterprise of his life, and that he should have
maintained garrisons in them to make good his communications
with the south, is not only probable,
but is rendered almost certain by the inscriptions
which several of them have yielded; but that, in
such circumstances, he should have planned and
executed the whole line of the Wall, its castles
and turrets, and several of the stations, is almost
incredible.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>POPULAR OPINION.</div>

<p class='c000'>But it may be asked, if Hadrian formed the whole
Barrier, how is it that the popular voice should ascribe
the most important part of it not to him, but
to Severus? That the Wall is generally called by
the name of Severus, is at once admitted. So long
ago as the reign of Elizabeth, Spencer wrote—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c005'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Next there came Tyne, along whose stony bank</div>
      <div class='line'>That Roman monarch built a brazen wall,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which mote the feebled Britons strongly flank</div>
      <div class='line'>Against the Picts, that swarmed over all,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which yet thereof <em>Gualsever</em> they do call.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Popular testimony, apart from the authentic records
of history, is of value for our present purpose only so
far as it is the traditional statement of the knowledge of
those who lived when the event took place. The
nearer to its source that we trace a tradition, the clearer
and more unequivocal it will become, if it have its origin
in truth. The popular opinion that Severus built
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>the Wall, will not stand this test. Whatever value
may be attached to the testimony of Gildas, the first
British historian, it is not denied that he records correctly
the hear-say evidence of his day. He does
not mention Severus, but tells us, that after the departure
of the Romans, the Britons, distressed by
the Picts and Scots, sought the assistance of their
former conquerors, and at their suggestion, and with
their assistance, raised first a wall of turf, and afterwards,
when that was found insufficient, a wall of
stone. The narrative of Gildas has been already
given. (<em>p.</em> 29.)</p>

<div class='sidenote'>BEDE’S TESTIMONY.</div>

<p class='c000'>Bede refers to the opinion that Severus built the
stone Wall, only to refute it; he says—</p>

<p class='c014'>Severus was drawn into Britain by the revolt of almost all
the confederate tribes; and, after many great and dangerous
battles, he thought fit to divide that part of the island which he
had recovered from the other unconquered nations, not with a
wall, as some imagine, but with a rampart. For a wall is made
of stones, but a rampart, with which camps are fortified to repel
the assaults of enemies, is made of sods, cut out of the earth, and
raised above the ground all around like a wall, having in front
of it the ditch whence the sods were taken, and strong stakes
of wood fixed upon its top. Thus Severus drew a great ditch
and strong rampart, fortified with several towers, from sea to
sea; and was afterwards taken sick, and died at York.</p>

<p class='c000'>He then repeats Gildas’ account of the origin of
the Wall, and adds—‘that it was not far from the
trench of Severus.’</p>

<p class='c000'>These quotations are made simply to prove, that
the testimony of tradition, at a period not long subsequent
to the departure of the Romans, was by no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>means decisive; no stress ought, therefore, now to be
laid upon it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>TRADITION IN ERROR.</div>

<p class='c000'>The popular report, which ascribes the building of
the Wall to Severus, is the less worthy of credit,
inasmuch as it imputes to him also the building of
the northern Barrier, which we know was the work
of Lollius Urbicus, in the reign of Antonine. Pinkerton
says, 'As to the Welsh name of <em>Gual Sever</em>,
which it is said they give to the Wall in the North
of England, it is also given to that between the
Firths of Scotland.<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c012'><sup>[134]</sup></a> A small grave-stone, which was
discovered in Falkirk church-yard, in the immediate
neighbourhood of the Antonine Wall, about the year
1815, confirms the testimony of Pinkerton upon this
point. The inscription, a cast of which I have seen,
records the burial there, in the reign of Fergus II.,
of ‘a knight, Rob. Graham, who first threw down the
Wall of Severus’ (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='fss'>ILLE EVERSVS VALL. SEVER</span></span>). If
popular opinion has erred with reference to the one
Wall, it may have erred with respect to the other also.<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c012'><sup>[135]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>But we ought not to expect minute accuracy in a
tradition transmitted through many generations. It
is enough that the general impress of the truth
remains. It is nothing surprising, that, after the
lapse even of a century or two, the name of Severus
should have been connected with every military
stronghold in the northern section of the island. As
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>having inflicted the last and heaviest blow upon it,
his hated memory would be the longest retained.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the absence of any decisive testimony from
the historians of Rome, respecting the emperor who
upreared the Murus, we may next examine the inscribed
stones which have been found upon it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>COMMEMORATIVE SLABS.</div>

<p class='c000'>In some instances, inscriptions attached to Roman
buildings give their history with great particularity.
This is the case with the Antonine Wall in Scotland.
Slabs inserted at intervals, record the name of the
reigning emperor, of his legate, of the troops engaged
upon the work, and also the number of paces
executed by each detachment. Unfortunately these
commemorative slabs are of rare occurrence in
the Lower Barrier, and the information given by
such as do exist, is very scanty. This will appear
the more surprising, if we bear in mind that the
English Wall is not only twice as long as the other,
but is built of stone throughout; the Scotch Wall
is chiefly formed of earth. On the theory, that
Hadrian reared all the members of the Barrier, the
paucity of inscriptions admits of easy explanation.
The custom of raising these memorials did not
commence until his day, and at the time of the
erection of the Wall was probably in its infancy; the
practice was in vogue during the reigns of several of
his successors, and was not discontinued until after
the time of Caracalla. If, on the other hand,
Severus built the Wall, it is a most unaccountable
thing that his soldiers have left no record of the fact
upon the line of the Wall itself, and but very scanty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>traces of his name even in the out-stations. This is
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>PAUCITY OF INSCRIPTIONS TO SEVERUS.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the more remarkable, when we remember that
the Wall was built by the same legions as were employed
upon the Vallum of the Upper Barrier. The
Antonine Wall was constructed by the twentieth
legion and by vexillations of the second, and sixth.
On the mural line of the Lower Barrier we frequently
meet with stones inscribed with the names and
insignia of the second, and sixth, legion, and occasionally
with those of the twentieth. If the
English Wall was built in A.D. 210, as is generally
stated, how is it that the troops disregarded a custom
so natural and so laudable as that which was
practised so extensively by their predecessors, in
A.D. 140? Extensive repairs were made by Caracalla
at <span class='sc'>Habitancum</span>, <span class='sc'>Bremenium</span>, and some other
stations; of these we have distinct records in the
inscriptions which remain. How is it, if the mind
and hand of his father gave being to the magnificent
fence of the English isthmus, that not one of the
many stones which he upreared records the fact?
Mural slabs and contemporary historians are alike
silent upon the subject, and, probably, for the simple
reason that Severus did not build it.</p>

<p class='c000'>It will serve the purposes of truth to cite all the
instances in which the name of either emperor has
been found upon the line; wood-cuts of all to which
I have had access, have been already presented to
the reader.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>INSCRIPTIONS NAMING HADRIAN.</div>

<p class='c000'>The name of Hadrian occurs in many instances.
At Jarrow a stone was found, and is figured in Brand,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>which was inscribed <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='fss'>OMNIVM FIL. HADRIANI</span></span>. In the
foundations of the castellum at Milking-gap a stone
was discovered (p. <a href='#Page_234'>234</a>), bearing in bold letters the
name of the emperor, and of his legate Aulus Platorius
Nepos. At Chesterholm a fragment of a precisely
similar inscription was found (p. <a href='#p241a'>241</a>). In the neighbourhood
of Bradley, two fragments were discovered,
which, when placed together, give us an accurate
copy of the same inscription (p. <a href='#p232'>232</a>). In the ruins
of the castellum near Cawfields, was a portion of
another, with a precisely similar inscription (p. <a href='#p251'>251</a>);
and near the eastern gateway of <span class='sc'>Æsica</span> a large tablet
was dug up, bearing the name of the same emperor
(p. <a href='#p256'>256</a>). In an outhouse, which probably occupies
the site of a castellum, at Chapel-house, in Cumberland,
a stone was found, which mentions Hadrian and
the twentieth legion (p. <a href='#p274'>274</a>). Horsley describes a
slab which he saw at Bewcastle, bearing the following
inscription—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c017'>
    <div><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>IMP.</em> CAES. TRA<em>IANO</em></span></div>

    <div><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">LICINIO PR<em>ISCO</em></span></div>
    <div><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">LEG. AVG. PR. PR.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In Gough’s Camden, a stone, inscribed to Hadrian
by the second legion, is stated to have been found at
Middleby; and at Moresby we have the fine slab
now at Whitehaven castle (p. <a href='#p367'>367</a>).</p>

<p class='c000'>It will perhaps be said that these inscriptions
prove nothing beyond the universally admitted facts,
that many of the stations existed in Hadrian’s day,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>and that the Vallum was raised by him. The reply
to this is, that several of them have been found at a
distance from any station, and on the line of the
Wall itself, and that too, in positions where it is farther
removed than usual from the Vallum. The occurrence
of three or four of them in mile-castles, seems to
prove that they owed their position there to no accidental
circumstance, and no one will deny that
these mile-towers were contemporaneous with the
Wall.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>INSCRIPTIONS TO SEVERUS.</div>

<p class='c000'>The force of these remarks will more clearly appear
after ascertaining what inscriptions bear the
name of Severus. If we turn to the inquiry with the
impression that he built the more important member
of the Barrier, we might expect to find the evidences
of the activity which prevailed in his day more
abundant than in the time of Hadrian. Such, however,
is not the fact. The one at Hexham (p. <a href='#Page_340'>340</a>)
was the only inscription to Severus which was known
to Gordon and Horsley. Well might Gordon, who
maintained the Septimian theory, denominate it—‘a
very precious jewel of antiquity.’ Hexham is nearly
four miles south of the Wall. To this must be added
the altar discovered at Old Carlisle (p. <a href='#Page_360'>360</a>),
which is about ten miles distant from the Wall;
and another in a dilapidated state, found at the same
place; and the gateway slab found at <span class='sc'>Habitancum</span>
(p. <a href='#Page_315'>315</a>), one of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>castra exploratorum</em></span> nearly ten
miles in advance of the Wall, recording the restoration
of part of the fortifications there. Besides these,
I know not of any inscriptions to Severus. I purposely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>omit all reference to an altar, said to have
been discovered at Netherby, bearing the inscription
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='fss'>SEPT. SEVERO IMP. QVI MVRVM HVNC CONDIDIT</span></span>, because,
both Gordon and Horsley pronounce it to be
spurious.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE GELT QUARRY.</div>

<p class='c000'>Much importance is attached by those who advocate
the claims of Severus to the inscription on the
face of the ancient quarry, on the river Gelt. Here,
it may be said, is the very spot from which the
stones of the Wall were taken, and the precise
date is fixed—the consulship of Aper and Maximus.
That the quarry was used by the Romans at this
period, is not a matter of dispute, but it is very
questionable whether much of the stone from it was
used in the building of the Wall, because, suitable
materials could be procured nearer at hand. The
year in which Aper and Maximus were consuls was
A.D. 207; the year in which, according to the received
reckoning, Severus came to Britain, was that
in which Geta and Caracalla were consuls, A.D. 208.<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c012'><sup>[136]</sup></a>
It is not likely that Severus would order the stones
to be quarried before his arrival in Britain. But,
allowing that the chronology of Severus’ reign is to
be received with some latitude, and granting that he
had landed in Britain in A.D. 207, some time would
necessarily elapse in making inquiries into the state
of the country, and no inconsiderable period would
be occupied in making surveys, even after the construction
of the Wall had been determined on. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>quarry has probably been wrought for some ordinary
purpose, perhaps for the erection of some buildings
in the station near Brampton, at the period in
question.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>HADRIAN’S QUARRIES.</div>

<p class='c000'>Evidence is not wanting to prove, on the other
hand, that quarries near the line of the Roman
Wall were wrought in the time of Hadrian. In
an old quarry near the top of Borcum, or Barcombe
(a hill near the village of Thorngrafton, and opposite
to the station of <span class='sc'>Borcovicus</span>), a large number of
Roman coins was found. They are described and
figured in the last Part of this work. Since none
of the pieces of this hoard were later than the time
of Hadrian, and the coins of his reign and Trajan’s
were peculiarly fresh, it is agreed that the treasure
must have been deposited in Hadrian’s time.
The quarry on Haltwhistle-fell (p. <a href='#Page_81'>81</a>), it will also
be remembered, bore the name of the sixth legion,
which, if the reasoning in the next paragraph be
admitted, will appear to have been inscribed before
the arrival of Severus in Britain.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has already been observed that numerous stones
along the line bear, without any addition, the names
of the second legion, the sixth, and the twentieth.
There can be no doubt that these legions and their
vexillations executed the principal part of the Work.
The main bodies of these forces, however, had their
head-quarters, at the time of the arrival of Severus,
in districts of the country southward of the Barrier
line. The second legion, after the building of the
Antonine Wall, appears to have gone to Carleon, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>South Wales, the Isca of the Romans. The sixth
legion removed to York before A.D. 190, where
it continued as long as the Romans remained
in the island. Horsley, speaking of the inscriptions
on the Wall which mention this legion,<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>MOVEMENTS OF THE LEGIONS.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
says, ’some of them, from the characters and other
circumstances, may be supposed as ancient as Hadrian’s
reign.' The twentieth legion had taken up
its abode at Chester, the <span class='sc'>Deva</span> of the Romans, as
early as the year 154. Though it is probable that
Septimius Severus may have taken detachments of
these legions with him in his Scottish campaign, it
is not likely that he would withdraw the main
bodies from forts of such importance; and those which
did accompany him would find the discharge of their
military duties sufficiently onerous, without engaging
in a work so vast as the building of the Wall.</p>

<p class='c000'>But, after all, the works themselves furnish us
with the best proof that the whole is one design, and
the production of one period. It is difficult to conceive
how any person can traverse the line of the
Barrier without coming to the conclusion, that all
the works—Vallum, Wall and fosse, turrets, castles,
stations, and outposts—are but so many parts of one
great design, essential to each other, and unitedly
contributing to the security of a dangerous frontier.
The Murus and the Vallum throughout their whole
course pursue tracks harmonizing with each other;
the Murus, however, selecting those acclivities from
which an attack from the north can be best repulsed—the
Vallum, those from which aggression
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>from the south can be repelled. Stukeley was unable
to resist the evidence of his senses. Speaking of the
works in the neighbourhood of Carvoran, he says—</p>

<div class='sidenote'>STUKELEY’S TESTIMONY.</div>

<p class='c014'>I suppose this Wall built by Severus is generally set upon
the same track as Hadrian’s Wall or Vallum of earth was;
for, no doubt, they there chose the most proper ground; but
there is a Vallum and ditch all the way accompanying the
Wall, and on the south side of it; and likewise studiously
choosing the southern declivity of the rising ground. I observe,
too, the Vallum (Wall?) is always to the north. It is
surprising that people should fancy this to be Hadrian’s Vallum;
it might possibly be Hadrian’s work, but may be called
the line of contravallation; for, in my judgment, the true intent,
both of Hadrian’s Vallum and Severus’s Wall, was,
in effect, to make a camp extending across the kingdom;
consequently, was fortified both ways, north and south:
at present, the Wall was the north side of it; that called
Hadrian’s work, the south side of it; hence we may well
suppose all the ground of this long camp, comprehended between
the Wall and the southern rampire, was the property
of the soldiers that guarded the Wall.—<cite>Iter Boreale</cite>, p. 59.</p>

<p class='c000'>Speaking of the works westward of Newcastle-upon-Tyne,
he says—</p>

<p class='c014'>The Vallum runs parallel to the Wall, but upon the declining
ground south, as the other north; this confirms me in
my suspicion, that both works were made at the same time,
and by the same persons, and with intent that this should be
a counter-guard to the other, the whole included space being
military ground.—<cite>Iter Boreale</cite>, 66.</p>

<p class='c000'>The reader needs scarcely to be reminded of the
striking illustration of these remarks which is furnished
by the appearance of the works a little to the
west of Carrhill, and by the fact, that for nearly ten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>miles in the middle of their course, the Vallum is
commanded by the heights on which the Wall stands.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>RELATIVE POSITION OF THE WORKS.</div>

<p class='c000'>Whenever the distance between the Wall and
Vallum varies, it is generally with some obvious
design in view. Thus, as Hodgson, who powerfully
supports the view here taken, remarks—</p>

<p class='c014'>The Vallum and Murus always contract the width of
the interval between them as they approach a river, apparently
for no other purpose than a close protection of the
military way, and the defence of one bridge; for if they had
passed the brooks and rivers on their line at any considerable
distance from each other, two bridges would have been necessary,
and two sets of guards to defend them: and here it
is not unimportant to remark, that the Murus always takes
that brow of the ridge it traverses, which is precipitous to
the north, and never deserts its straightest or most defensible
course to find a convenient situation for a bridge, while the
Vallum almost invariably bends inwards as it approaches a
bridge, and diverges outwards as it leaves it.—<cite>Hist. Nor.</cite> II. iii.</p>

<p class='c000'>Horsley’s plan of the Barrier between <span class='sc'>Cilurnum</span>
and <span class='sc'>Magna</span>, which is copied on <a href='#p044b'>Plate II</a>., will afford
several examples of the truth of these remarks.</p>

<p class='c000'>The position of the Vallum and Murus, in relation
to the stations, furnishes additional evidence. The
Murus usually forms the northern wall of the station,
or comes up to the northern cheek of its eastern
and western gates, while the Vallum protects
its southern rampart, or comes up to the lower
side of its doorways. The two lines give complete
protection to the camps, and to the roads leading to
and from them. On the supposition that the Vallum
is an independent fortification, and that it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>constructed nearly a century before the Wall was
thought of, we must concede that its plan was such
as to give the stations the least possible support, to
leave them, in short, in a great measure exposed to
the enemy. The manner in which the two walls
combine in giving strength to a station, is very well
shewn in Warburton’s plan of the works in the vicinity
of <span class='sc'>Cilurnum</span> (Plate II). It is scarcely possible
to deny the justice of the remark, which he
appends to the title—‘A Plan of <span class='sc'>Cilurnum</span> ... with
part of the Plan of Severus’ Wall and Hadrian’s
Vallum, shewing how they are connected at the stations,
and by their mutual relation to one another, <em>must
have been one entire united defence or fortification</em>.'</p>

<div class='sidenote'>SEVERUS REPAIRED THE WALL.</div>

<p class='c000'>It is not improbable that Severus may have repaired
some portions of the Wall, and perhaps added
some few subsidiary defences. Richard of Cirencester
gives us correct information upon several
points connected with Roman Britain, which we do
not learn from other authors; it is not unlikely that
his view of the subject of our present study may be
the correct one. He says—</p>

<p class='c014'>About this time the emperor Hadrian, visiting this island,
erected a Wall, justly wonderful, and left Julius Severus his
deputy in Britain.... Virius Lupus did not perform
many splendid actions, for his glory was intercepted by the
unconquerable Severus, who, having rapidly put the enemy to
flight, <em>repaired the Wall of Hadrian</em>, now become ruinous,
and restored it to its former perfection. Had he lived, he intended
to extirpate the very name of the barbarians.</p>

<p class='c000'>The supposition that Hadrian built the Wall is
consistent with the accounts which historians give
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>us of his attachment to architectural undertakings.
One writer, of great research, says of him—</p>

<div class='sidenote'>HADRIAN A GREAT BUILDER.</div>
<p class='c014'>No prince, perhaps, ever raised so many public and private
edifices as Hadrian. In every city of note, throughout the
empire, some erection perpetuated his memory: bridges,
aqueducts, temples, and palaces, rose on every hand. Many
cities, likewise, were either wholly built or repaired by him.
<em>Building seems, indeed, to have been a main feature in his system
of government.</em> He was the first who appointed that each
cohort should have its quota of masons, architects, and all
kinds of workmen needed for the erection and adornment of
public edifices.—<cite>Hist. Rome</cite>, <em>Tract Soc. London 277</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is perhaps needless to pursue the subject further.
More might easily be said; but I was unwilling,
on a point of so much importance, to say less.
The reader will not fail to perceive what an
impressive view the works of the mural barrier,
considered as one vast scheme, and not as a series
of after-thoughts, give of the mighty conceptions
and energies of imperial Rome.</p>

<p class='c000'>In taking leave of those renowned men, Hadrian
and Severus, it may be allowable to advert to the
testimony which, before departing this life, they are
said to have given as to the vanity of all earthly things.
Hadrian, who used to say, that an emperor should
be like the sun, visiting all the regions of the earth,
found himself then, in darkness. His knowledge of
the Eleusinian mysteries gave him no peace; he
addressed his soul in these words:—</p>

Most apposite is the remark
of Dr. Johnson, that
‘Whatever withdraws
us from the power
of our senses; whatever
makes the past, the distant,
or the future predominate
over the present, advances us in the dignity
of thinking beings.’ Few things are so well
calculated to produce this effect, as the altars and
lettered tablets that have been left on our soil by the
Romans. When we but glance at them, who is not
moved at the reflection, that they were chiselled by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>hands which for so many centuries have mouldered

The old Roman seems to arise from the tomb,

<div class='sidenote'>LETTERED STONES.</div>

<p class='c000'>The region of the Wall has yielded more inscribed
stones of the Roman period than any other portion
of the kingdom. Many of them have already been
presented to the reader; a few others will here be
described. The lettered stones of the mural line
may be divided into three classes—altars, funereal
slabs, and centurial stones.</p>

<h3 class='c025'>ALTARS.</h3>

<div class='sidenote c001'>PARTS OF AN ALTAR.</div>

<p class='c000'>The offering of such sacrifices as were supposed
to be acceptable to their deities, formed an essential
part of the religion of the Greeks and Romans.
Very numerous are the altars which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>have been discovered on the line of the Wall.
Many of them are small, some not larger than the
palm of the hand, rough in the workmanship, and
without any inscription; others are of large size,</p>

<p class='c000'>and of ornate character. The usual form of them is
shewn in the annexed
cut. The inscription is
on the face of the altar;
the base and upper portion
project a little beyond
the sides. A small
cavity on the top called
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>focus</em></span>, or hearth, received
the offering. The
sides of the altar were
frequently adorned with carvings representing the
victims, the implements used in sacrifice, and insignia
of the god. On the altar<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c012'><sup>[137]</sup></a> before us, we have represented
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>præfericulum</em></span>, or pitcher, which contained
the wine for the offering; the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>patera</em></span>, a round,
shallow dish, generally with a handle, which was
used in throwing a small portion of the wine upon
the altar; the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>securis</em></span>, or axe, with which the animal
was slain; and the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>culter</em></span>, or knife, used in flaying or
dividing it. In the Chesterholm altar, figured <em>p.</em> 240,
the sacrificial ox is represented; and on the sides of
the altar to Jupiter, which is shewn on page 290, the
thunder-bolt of the god, and the wheel of Nemesis—
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>the emblem of swift vengeance—are given. The
small size of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>focus</em></span> proves that the offerings presented
to the deities occupied a very small bulk.
When an animal was slain, a portion of the entrails
was often all that fell to the lot of the god.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frequently the offering consisted of a little barley-meal,
some fruit, some frankincense, or chips of fragrant
wood, with wine or milk. Occasions of sacrifice
were often times of merry-making. The
slain victim and the dedicated wine formed the
ready materials of a feast. Ovid sarcastically represents
an old woman performing the rites due to
the goddess of Silence; upon her offering (three
grains of incense) she allows a few drops of wine to
fall, and assisted by her companions, though needing
little help, she drinks up the remainder, departing
from her devotions tipsy, and anything but taciturn.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Two lines have been purposely erased, perhaps in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>consequence of some error committed by the
sculptor. The town of Brixia, the modern Brescia,
is situated on a feeder of the Po. Petronius, it
would appear, still remembered, and doubtless with
affection, his former home in sunny Italy. Storks
adorn both sides of the altar; the object of their
introduction is rather doubtful. In the Risingham
slab, now at Cambridge, to which reference
has already been made (<em>p.</em> 332), a cock is associated
with the figure of Mars, and a stork with that of
Victory. Can the stork have been the emblem of victory,
as the cock was of the god of war? The powerful
wing and stately motions of this bird render it a
fitting emblem of the goddess whose favours Petronius
must often have sought. The inscription is
distinct, and strikingly displays the polytheism of the
Romans. Petronius associates with Jupiter, not
only all the immortal gods, but the genius of the
pretorium also.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>POLYTHEISM OF ROME.</div>

<p class='c000'>Not only were the superior deities and invisible
genii blended in one invocation, but mortal men
were not unfrequently associated with the greatest
of the gods on the same altar. This is the case in
one already described (<em>p.</em> <a href='#Page_63'>63</a>). Quintus Verius, on
an altar found at Housesteads, calls upon Jupiter,
the best and greatest, together with ‘the deities of
Augustus.’ The emperor himself is probably intended
by this phrase, not the gods whom the emperor
worshipped. The use of the noun in the
plural number, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>numina</em></span>, is not opposed to this view.
Horsley remarks that <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>numina</em></span> is frequently, in classical
writers, applied to a particular deity; thus we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>have <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>numina Dianæ</em></span> in Horace, and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>numina Ph&oelig;bi</em></span>
in Virgil. The emperors, we know, were frequently
worshipped as gods. The Mantuan bard, addressing
Augustus, has no doubt of his divinity, though he
knows not what region to assign to his especial care;</p>

<p class='c000'>The lower lines of the inscription of this altar are
much injured; they probably refer to the restoration of
some buildings. The upper portion is sufficiently
plain. Peregrinus addresses first the deity of the
place over which his arms had triumphed; lest
the local god should not smile benignantly, he
resorts to Fortune, who had conducted him safely to
the land of his adoption; if this deity should fail him,
he thinks to find a refuge in the genius of the eternal
city; but driven from this resource, there is nothing
for it, but to trust to fate or chance.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the back of this altar (which as it is at present
placed at Whitehaven Castle, cannot be seen), are
inscribed the words, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='fss'>VOLANTI VIVAS</span></span>. This was probably
the expression of the good wishes of some
party for his friend, inscribed for greater efficacy on
the sacred stone; and may be translated, Volantius,
long may you live!</p>

<div class='sidenote'>ALTARS TO MARS.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>Mars is occasionally addressed, though not so
frequently as we might expect in a chain of mural
garrisons. Two small altars dedicated to him have
already been introduced. On several altars, chiefly
found in Cumberland, he is addressed by the name
<span id='p401a' class='figright id039'><img src='images/i_p401a.jpg' alt='Altar, Deo Cocidio' class='ig001' /></span>of Cocidius. One which was found at
Bank’s-head, and is now preserved at
Lanercost Priory, is here introduced.
An altar found at Lancaster bearing
the inscription, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='fss'>DEO SANCTO MARTI
COCIDIO</span></span>, is the authority for supposing
that Cocidius was a name of Mars.
The altar before us has been dedicated
by the soldiers of the twentieth legion,
surnamed the Valiant and Victorious;
the boar, the badge of the legion, is at
the bottom of the altar. It appears also that Mars
was sometimes styled Belatucadrus, the expression
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='fss'>DEO MARTI BELATUCADRO</span></span> being found upon some
altars; the altars to Belatucadrus are, however, confined
to Cumberland. One of them is here
<span id='p401b' class='figleft id033'><img src='images/i_p401b.jpg' alt='Altar, Deo Belatucadro' class='ig001' /></span>given. It was found at Walton Castlesteads,
where it still remains. The letters are
rudely carved, and the last two lines not
very intelligible. The name Belatucadrus
or Belatucader is derived from the words
Baal and Cadir; and probably means—The
invincible or omnipotent Baal. The fact that
Baal, the great idol of the east, found votaries in
Britain shews how easy it is to propagate error.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was the practice of the Romans to adopt the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>deities of the countries which they subdued, and
they may be supposed to have sought to amalgamate
with their own god of war, the corresponding divinity
worshipped in that part of Britain where these
altars were reared.</p>

<div id='p402'  class='figright id039'>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>MINERVA.</div>

<p class='c000'>The worship of Minerva was not neglected by the
soldiers of the Wall. The wood-cut exhibits an
altar to the virgin goddess, which
was found in the station at Rochester;
it is now at Alnwick
Castle. Several others exist. Science
is required in the arts of
war as well as peace. The victory
which mere daring achieved,
was by the Greeks and Romans
ascribed to the intervention of
Mars; that which was the result
of skilful strategy to the influence
of Minerva. This altar was consecrated
by Julius Carantus.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>FORTUNA.</div>

<p class='c000'>Fortune was one of the favourite deities of Rome.
The great confidence which the Romans placed in
her is expressed in the story related by Plutarch,
that on entering Rome she put off her wings and
shoes, and threw away her globe, as she intended to
take up her permanent abode among the Romans.
Several altars addressed to Fortune have been
found on the line of the Wall. One of the most
remarkable is shewn in the annexed cut. It was
found in a building in the south-east corner of the
station at Risingham, and is now in the Museum of</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>Antiquities, Newcastle-upon-Tyne. The great peculiarity
of it is, that the projecting base of the altar
is provided with a focus, and that on the projection
the inscription is repeated. It reads—</p>

<p class='c000'>The altar, when in its original position, was raised
by means of two courses of masonry considerably
above the level of the ground. The object of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>second focus is a matter of conjecture. According
to the grammarians, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>altare</em></span> (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>alta ara</em></span>, high altar) was
dedicated only to the gods above, whilst the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>ara</em></span> was
both lower, and employed in sacrificing to the gods
below as well as those above. Can Fortune have
been viewed in the double capacity of a superior and
inferior divinity, and can the tribune, Valerius
Longinus, have sought to secure the favour of the
powerful deity both in this life and the one to come!</p>

<div class='sidenote'>WORSHIP OF MITHRAS.</div>

<p class='c000'>The various ceremonies which were observed in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>the worship of Mithras, are supposed to have been
emblematic of the different influences exercised
by the sun upon vegetable and animal life. The
notices which we have of the meaning of these
emblems are, however, a mass of mysticism and absurdity.
The god is commonly represented as a
youth wearing the Phrygian cap and attire, and
<span id='p406' class='figright id022'><img src='images/i_p406.jpg' alt='Attendant of Mithras' class='ig001' /></span>kneeling on a bull thrown on the ground, the
throat of which he is cutting. He is usually accompanied
by two attendants, the one
bearing an uplifted torch, representing
the sun in the vernal equinox,
ascending to the zenith of his power,
the other, an extinguished torch,
resting on the ground, emblematic
of the orb of day, when hastening
to the winter solstice. The wood-cut
here introduced exhibits one of
these figures (now at Newcastle-upon-Tyne),
which was found in
the cave at Housesteads.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Mithraic worship was introduced into the
western world, from Persia, about the time of Julius
Cæsar, and speedily spread over all parts of the
empire. It appears to have outlived other forms
of idolatry in Europe. Its favourers seem to have
abandoned polytheism; on the line of the Wall at
least, the name of Mithras is not combined with
that of any other deity. This circumstance, together
with the laborious, though vain, researches of its
philosophical supporters, recommended it to those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>who rejected the pure and simple truths of Christianity.</p>

<p class='c000'>The temples of Mithras generally consisted of a
cave, or a small building from which the light was
excluded. A cave was adopted, ‘because,’ says Porphyry,
‘a cave is the image and symbol of the world,’
and it was dark, ‘because the essence of the virtues
is obscure.’ All who sought the favour of this god
were subjected to a long course of painful initiatory
discipline. Nonnius, a Greek poet, says—</p>

severer; and after the whole course is gone through, they
are initiated. Fire and water are the sorts of punishment
which they endure. These torments are said to be inflicted
to produce examples of piety and greatness of mind under
sufferings. After they have been many days in water, they
cast themselves into fire; then live in desert places, and there
subdue the cravings of hunger; and thus, as we have said,
the aspirant goes through the whole course of eighty torments;
which if he survive, then he is initiated into the mysteries
of Mithras.</p>

<p class='c000'>Human sacrifices seem to have been used in
the worship of Mithras. Photius, in his life of
Athanasius, asserts that there was a Greek temple
in Alexandria, in which, in ancient times, the Greeks
performed sacred rites to Mithras, sacrificing men,
women, and children, and auguring from their entrails.
Pliny tells us that in the year of Rome 657,
a decree of the senate was passed, forbidding the
immolation of man; for till that time monstrous
solemnities were openly celebrated.<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c012'><sup>[139]</sup></a> The emperor
Heliogabalus, a native of Syria, styled himself high
priest of Mithras. His assassination is partly ascribed
to the horror with which the people listened
to the tales of magic rites in which he was concerned,
and of human victims secretly slaughtered.<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c012'><sup>[140]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>MITHRAIC CAVE.</div>

<p class='c000'>The cave at Housesteads in which the Mithraic
sculptures were found, was situated in the valley to
the south of the station. It was discovered in 1822
by the tenant of the farm in which it stood, who fixed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>upon the spot as one likely to yield him the material
which he required for building a stone fence hard by.
The building was square; its sides faced the cardinal
points. It had been originally, as was usually
<span id='p409' class='figleft id015'><img src='images/i_p409.jpg' alt='Zodiacal Tablet, Borcovicus' class='ig001' /></span>the case in a Mithraic temple, permeated by a small
stream. Hodgson, who saw it as soon as it was laid
bare, says, ‘The cave itself seems to have been
a low contemptible hovel, dug out of a hill side,
lined with dry walls, and covered with earth or
straw.’ Though the building has been entirely
removed, a small hollow is left which marks the spot
where it stood. All the sculptured stones have
happily been placed in the custody of the Society
of Antiquaries, Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Amongst
them, besides the altars
already given,
and some which it
has not been thought
necessary here to
engrave, is the curious
stone shewn in
the wood-cut. It
represents Mithras,
surrounded by the
zodiac. The signs of
cancer and libra are
omitted. The zodiacal
tablet assumes
an egg-like form,
probably to symbolize
the principle of generation. The god holds
a sword in his right hand, and a peculiar spiral
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>object in his left. It more nearly resembles an ear
of corn than the flame of a torch. We are reminded
<span id='p410a' class='figleft id006'><img src='images/i_p410a.jpg' alt='Pine-apple Ornament, etc., Cilurnum' class='ig001' /></span>by it of the ornaments resembling
pine apples, which
are frequently found on the
line of the Wall; and were
probably connected with the
worship of this deity. The
example here figured, as well
as the small altar which accompanies it, was found at
Housesteads; both are now preserved at Chesters.</p>

<p class='c000'>The accompanying wood-cut represents a subject
which is supposed to be connected with the mysteries
of Mithraic worship. The slab was found at
<span class='sc'>Cilurnum</span>, and is now at Alnwick Castle. Though
not satisfied with Hodgson’s description of it, I am
unable to supply a better. He says;—</p>

<p class='c014'>The sculpture is in two compartments: that on the left
seems to contain a lion, statant, raising the head of a naked
and dead man: that on the right, a figure of Mithras seated
on a bench, and having a flag in one hand, a wand in the
other, and on its head the Persian tiara.(?) I would hazard a
conjecture that the whole relates to the Mithraic rites called
Leontica; for the lion, in the zodiac of the ancient heathens,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>stood for Mithras, or the sun, which threw its greatest heat
upon the earth during its course through the constellation Leo.</p>

<p class='c000'>Numerous as are the altars on the
line of the Wall to the Persian god,
only one has been found dedicated to
Apollo, the Grecian representative of
the luminary of day. It was discovered
in the summer of 1850, lying
near a spring in the vicinity of the
Cawfield mile-castle, about midway between
the Wall and the Vallum, and
is now preserved in the collection of
antiquities at Chesters. The following
reading must be regarded as,
in a great measure, conjectural; no doubt, however,
can exist as to the deity to which it is dedicated.</p>

Every fountain and river, every hill and forest,
had its tutelary deity; every product of earth, air, or
sea, its guardian; every place its genius; every household
its <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>penates</em></span>. The antiquities found on the Wall
furnish us with numerous illustrations of this fact.

at Birdoswald, and is now at Lanercost.</p>

The construction of the sentence is peculiar, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>admits of two renderings. Taking <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>nupta est</em></span> to signify
dedicated, a peculiar use of the word, suggested perhaps
by its etymological relationship with the one
which it governs, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>nymphis</em></span>, the inscription will read—</p>

<p class='c014'>A soldier, warned in a dream, directed the erection of this
altar, which is dedicated by Fabius to the nymphs to whom
worship is due.</p>

<p class='c000'>The other method of rendering it is the following,—</p>

<p class='c014'>A soldier, warned in a dream, directed her (<em>eam</em> supplied)
who is married to Fabius to erect this altar to the nymphs
to whom worship is due.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE GODS OF THE MOUNTAINS.</div>

<p class='c000'>According to either interpretation the altar was
erected to the sylphs of the fountain, in consequence
of a dream. The lively imagination of the Roman
has invested the humble spring where it originally
stood with such an air of romance, as to render it a
matter of regret that the altar does not still grace
the spot.</p>

<p class='c000'>The adjoining wood-cut represents
a small altar found at Rutchester,
<span class='sc'>Vindobala</span>, and now in the Castle of
Newcastle-upon-Tyne. The inscription
reads—To the gods of the
mountains, Julius Firminus, the
decurion,<a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c012'><sup>[141]</sup></a> erected this.

<span id='p415b' class='figleft id033'><img src='images/i_p415b.jpg' alt='Altar to Epona, Magna' class='ig001' /></span>altar is dedicated, was the
protectress of horses; images of her were
to be seen in most stables. Juvenal’s
dandy jockey swore by her alone. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>altar was found at Carvoran, and is now in the High
School of Edinburgh. The accompanying example
<span id='p416a' class='figright id033'><img src='images/i_p416a.jpg' alt='Altar, sculptured with a Toad, Cilurnum' class='ig001' /></span>is not the only instance of a toad being
represented on an altar. This was
found at Chesters, <span class='sc'>Cilurnum</span>, where
it is still preserved. Did the Romans
stoop so low as to worship reptiles?
If so, the superstitious practice has
probably been derived from the east. Dr. Kitto remarks,
‘The importance attached to the frog, in some
parts of Egypt, is shewn by its being embalmed,
and honoured with sepulture in the tombs of Thebes.
In the Egyptian mythology, the frog was an emblem
of man in embryo.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'>VITERES.</div>

<p class='c000'>Many altars have been found on the line dedicated
to gods unknown to Rome’s Pantheon, and
supposed to have a purely local celebrity. The
engraving exhibits one of a numerous
class.<a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c012'><sup>[142]</sup></a> It was discovered
near Thirlwall Castle about 1757,
in the course of the formation of
the military road, and shortly after
presented to the Society of Antiquaries.
Vitres, or Viteres, or Veteres,
is a god whose name is confined
to the north of Britain.
Hodgson remarks, that Vithris
was a name of Odin, as we find in the death-song of
Lodbroc—'I will approach the courts of Vithris,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>with the faltering voice of fear.' If Viteres and the
Scandinavian Odin be identical, we are thus furnished
with evidence of the early settlement of the Teutonic
tribes in England. The altar given on page <a href='#p395'>395</a> is
<span id='p417a' class='figright id042'><img src='images/i_p417a.jpg' alt='Altar to Viteres, Condercum' class='ig001' /></span>also dedicated to Viteres. The occurrence of the
name of this god in a plural form, as
in the annexed example, which was
found at <span class='sc'>Condercum</span>, and is now at
Somerset-house, has suggested the
idea, that Viteres is not the proper
name of a god, but that <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>diis veteribus</em></span>—the
ancient gods—is the inscription
intended. Most probably, however,
Viteres was the name of a local deity.</p>

<div id='p417b'  class='figleft id042'>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>LOCAL DEITIES.</div>

<p class='c000'>The next altar is also dedicated to a local goddess;
at least it is not easy to give any more satisfactory
account of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Dea Hamia</em></span>. The altar
was found near Thirlwall castle,
and belongs to the Society of Antiquaries,
London.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>DEÆ MATRES.</div>

<p class='c000'>We now proceed to an important
group of altars and sculptures, which,
if not strictly local, are yet chiefly
found in those regions of Europe
which were swept by the Teutonic
wave in its progress westward. They have been
met with in England, the Netherlands, along the
banks of the Rhine and other parts of Germany, and
in France. These deities, when sculptured, are represented
as triple, generally seated, clothed in long
flowing drapery, and bearing in their laps baskets of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>fruit. A slab, of which a drawing has already been
given (p. <a href='#p140'>140</a>), is inscribed <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='fss'>MATRIBUS CAMPESTRIBUS</span></span>,
to the mothers of the plains; it probably refers to
the deities in question. An altar found in the same
<span id='p418a' class='figright id043'><img src='images/i_p418a.jpg' alt='Altar to the Three Lamiæ, Condercum' class='ig001' /></span>station, <span class='sc'>Condercum</span>, and now in
the vaults of Somerset-house, is
inscribed <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='fss'>LAMIIS TRIBUS</span></span>, to the three
Lamiæ. The wood-cut accurately
represents it. In Rich’s companion
to the Latin Dictionary, the
Lamiæ are represented as ‘Vampires;
believed to be malignant
spirits of the female sex, who wandered
about at night in the guise
of old hags, sucking blood, and
devouring the flesh of human beings. This superstition,’
continues the writer, ‘originated in Egypt.’
In corroboration of the Egyptian origin of this class
of demons, it may be stated that small images, arranged
in triplets, are of common occurrence among</p>

</div>
<p class='c000'>the antiquities of Egypt.
The cuts here introduced
exhibit two groups of
this class of idols, selected
from a large number
of similar sets, in the
possession of his Grace
the duke of Northumberland,
at Alnwick Castle. Their resemblance to
some of those found upon the line of the Wall is striking.
The foreign origin of these mother-deities is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>further proved by their being denominated in inscriptions
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='fss'>MATRES TRAMARINÆ</span></span>, Transmarine Mothers.
The altar here figured is an example of this kind;
it was found at <span class='sc'>Habitancum</span>, and is now preserved
<span id='p419' class='figleft id030'><img src='images/i_p419.jpg' alt='Altar to the Transmarine Mothers, Habitancum' class='ig001' /></span>at Alnwick Castle. The inscription
records, that Julius Victor
dedicated it in discharge of a
vow freely and deservedly to the
Transmarine Mothers. This Victor,
it appears by another inscription,
was a tribune of the first
cohort of the Vangiones, a Germanic
tribe. On none of these altars
are the deities distinguished
by a proper name. This would seem to be in conformity
with the superstitious feelings of the middle
ages in England and Germany, where it was
thought unlucky to call the fairies and elves by
any other denominations than the respectful titles
of ‘the ladies,’ or ‘the good people.’ Several sculptures
representing, as is supposed, the mother-goddesses,
have been found on the line of the Wall.
One group, found at Housesteads, and now in the
castle of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, is drawn (fig. 4) on
<a href='#p224d'>Plate XI</a>. When seen by Horsley, this slab had
in the upper part of it two fishes and a sea-goat
in relief. Two other sets got at the same place,
are figured in the Britannia Romana. In one of
them, the central or chief figure is represented as
bound by the legs. The ancients, in order to prevent
a deity, whose favour they coveted, taking his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>departure against their will, not unfrequently used

of securing him by chains.
At Netherby, there are
three sculptures belonging
to this class. One of them,
shewn in the wood-cut,
is in a perfect condition.
The figures are standing,
an ample covering
envelopes their heads, and a short tunic scantily
<span id='p420b' class='figright id032'><img src='images/i_p420b.jpg' alt='Sculpture to the Deæ Matres, at Netherby' class='ig001' /></span>invests their bodies. Another
group, here engraved, has
met with the usual fate of
Roman sculptures in the
north of England—they have
suffered decapitation; the
ample folds of the garments by which they are
<span id='p420c' class='figleft id013'><img src='images/i_p420c.jpg' alt='Sculpture to the Deæ Matres, at Netherby' class='ig001' /></span>clothed have happily not
been disturbed, and the
central or chief personage
holds a basket of fruit.
The third sculpture is
of larger size and has
suffered more extensive
injury; the left hand
figure of the group only
remains; she is seated,
and holds fruit in her lap.
The Byzantine character
of the drapery will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>be noticed. At Nether-hall another fragment of a
<span id='p421' class='figright id042'><img src='images/i_p421.jpg' alt='Sculpture to the Deæ Matres, at Nether-hall' class='ig001' /></span>group, procured from the neighbouring
station, is preserved—the left hand
figure has been broken off; the two
remaining ladies wear the same cowl-like
head-dress as the Netherby
mothers; shewn on the former page.
Mr. Thomas Wright, speaking of these mythic personages,
says—</p>

<p class='c014'>The ancient mythology of the Germanic race was not entirely
eradicated by Christianity; and it is interesting to
trace it as reflected in the popular superstitions of the present
day. The reverence for the three goddesses who presided
over the woods and fields, pre-arranged the fates of individuals,
and dispensed the blessings of Providence to mankind,
may thus be traced down to a comparatively late period, both
in Germany and in England. They are sometimes regarded as
the three Fates—the <i>Norni</i> of the north, the wælcyrian of
the Anglo-Saxons (the weird sisters, transformed in Shakespeare
into three witches), disposing of the fates of individuals,
and dealing out death and life. But they are also found
distributing rewards and punishments, giving wealth and
prosperity, and conferring fruitfulness. They are the three
fairies who are often introduced in the fairy legends of a later
period, with these same characteristics.<a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c012'><sup>[143]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>INTRODUCTION OF CHRISTIANITY.</div>

<p class='c000'>After so long a companionship with the heathen
relics found on the line of the Wall, the reader will
naturally ask—Have no Christian remains been
found?—Does no memorial record the name of
<span class='sc'>Jehovah</span>, the living God? A negative reply must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>be given to the inquiry. There is, however,
abundant evidence to prove, that Christianity was
extensively diffused through the world long before
the Romans departed from Britain. Tacitus tells
us, that in his day there was a great multitude
of Christians at Rome itself. The younger Pliny,
in the second century, addressing the emperor,
complains that the heathen temples were almost
deserted. Justin Martyr says, there is not a
nation in which prayers and thanksgivings are not
offered up in the name of the crucified Jesus; and
Tertullian, the most ancient of the Latin fathers, appealing
to the magistrates, says, ‘We are but of
yesterday, yet we have filled every place, your cities,
garrisons, and free towns, your camps, senate, and
forum; we have left nothing empty but your temples.’
Britain early received the glad tidings. ‘The
concurrent voice of antiquity,’ says Mr. Thackeray,
‘although it has not designated the individuals who
were the immediate instruments of Providence in
enlightening Britain, assigns the year 60 as about
the period when the Christian religion was introduced
into this island.’ At this time there were not
fewer than 48,000 Roman soldiers, including their
auxiliaries, in this country, some of whom must have
been well acquainted with the name of Christ. In
the army there would be some centurions like Cornelius,
some deputies like Sergius Paulus, who, not
content with knowing the truth themselves, endeavoured
to communicate it to others, and yet these
Christian soldiers have, along the line of the Wall,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>left no memorial of their faith. The God whom
they served required not the erection of an altar of
stone, or an offering of frankincense. Their ‘inscription’
was, a holy life, ‘seen and read of all men.’
Notwithstanding the example and teaching of such
men, it is a lamentable fact, that heathenism continued
to rear its head in Britain until near the
close of the period of Roman occupation, as
several of the altars found on the line of the
Wall clearly testify.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>CHRISTIAN SYMBOL.</div>

<p class='c000'>Brand conceived that an altar discovered at Rutchester,
and now in the museum at Newcastle-upon-Tyne,
exhibited the Christian symbol. It may well
be doubted whether the rude carving to which he
refers, is any thing more than a partially obliterated
letter. There are other letters, evidently of modern
fabrication, carved on this altar.</p>

<p class='c000'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Fas est ab hoste doceri.</em></span> An obvious remark clothed
in Horsley’s own language, and extracted from a
work that is now scarce, will form a suitable conclusion
to this section. Speaking of vows in sickness
he says—</p>

<p class='c014'>There is one thing in these pagan votive altars that may
be a shame and reproach to a great many who call themselves
Christians; and that is, the willingness and cheerfulness with
which they paid, or pretended to pay, the vows they had made.
Such as have any acquaintance with those things, know how
commonly these letters <span class='fss'>V. S. L. M.</span> or <span class='fss'>V. S. L. L. M.</span>, are added at
the end of inscriptions that are on such altars, whereby they
signified how <em>willingly</em> and <em>cheerfully</em>, as well as <em>deservedly</em>,
they performed the vows they had made, viz., <em>votum solvit
libens merito</em>, or <em>votum solvit libens, lubens</em> (or <em>lætus</em>) <em>merito</em>.
Much more <em>deservedly</em>, and therefore more <em>willingly</em> and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span><em>cheerfully</em>, should the vows made to the Most High, to the
true and living God, be paid or performed to him, and particularly
the vows made in trouble.<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c012'><sup>[144]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c025'>SEPULCHRAL INSCRIPTIONS.</h3>

<div class='sidenote c001'>MONUMENTAL SLABS.</div>

<p class='c000'>Extreme importance was attached by both Greeks
and Romans to the due discharge of the rites of sepulture.
Until earth had been three times sprinkled
over the body of the departed, his spirit was conceived
to be denied admission into the Elysian
fields. The practice of burning the dead became
common at Rome about the latter period of the republic.
The inconvenience and expense of the process
would necessarily restrict it to persons of some
wealth. After the pile was consumed, the ashes of
the deceased were gathered up by the nearest relative,
and deposited in an urn. There are numerous
instances in Britain of the Romans having buried
their dead entire. Skeletons have been found in
London, which Mr. Charles Roach Smith considers
must have been deposited in the higher empire. As
Christianity gained ground, the custom of burning
the dead fell into disuse; the early Christians were
unwilling to do needless violence to the dust of a fellow
disciple, and resolved to discontinue the superstitious
ceremonies which usually attended cremation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whether the body was previously reduced to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>ashes, or deposited in the ground unburnt, it was
usual to raise a mound over the spot.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>FUNERAL URN.</div>

<p class='c000'>Sometimes, instead of a mound of earth, a monument
of stone covered the place where the sepulchral
urn was deposited. This was the case at
<span class='sc'>Bremenium</span>, as already described (<em>p.</em> 326). With
the ashes or body of the deceased, it was usual to
deposit a small brass coin to answer the demands of
Charon. 'This custom of burying valuables and
coins with the dead is by no means extinct; the
humbler Irish will pawn their clothes to provide
fresh pieces of money to throw into the coffins of
their departed friends.'<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c012'><sup>[145]</sup></a> The Romans, as formerly
observed, did not usually deposit either the unburnt
bodies of the dead, or their ashes, within the walls
of towns or stations. A curious exception to this
practice has lately been noticed. In the month of
October last (1850), a funereal urn was discovered
within the station of <span class='sc'>Borcovicus</span>, near the north-west
corner. It was sunk in the earth, and was covered
by an oblong flat stone, without inscription.
The vase, which was of earthen-ware, and altogether
devoid of ornament, was globular in its form, and of
large dimensions. It measured two feet in diameter,
and two feet in height. It contained ashes, amongst
which was found a solitary silver coin of Hadrian.
This urn is preserved at Chesters. On the slab covering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>the remains of the deceased person, the name
and age were not unfrequently inscribed. The
carving, which sometimes includes an effigy of
the individual, is often very rude; the back of the
stone is, for the most part, undressed. The inscriptions
on these ‘frail memorials’ which in the mural
region have come down to our times, and ‘implore
the passing tribute of a sigh,’ almost uniformly commence
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>DII MANES.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
with the letters D. M.—<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>diis manibus</em></span>. The
shades or departed spirits are, probably, themselves
intended in this address, though much confusion exists
upon the subject in the works of the ancient
writers. In the following lines, Ovid represents the
manes as being objects of worship:—</p>

of piety to a beloved daughter has not been forgotten:
the altar that bears the memorial of your affection
still exists, though it has been banished from the
custody of the ashes which were committed to its
care.’ Though painful, it is yet pleasant to notice the
heavings of natural affection in the martial bosom
of a Roman soldier. This stone differs from most of
the sepulchral monuments, in being an altar instead
of a slab, and in not mentioning the age of the deceased.
It has been remarked that the larger proportion
of the tomb-stones of the mural region
record the deaths of young persons. The climate
of the north of England, particularly of the exposed
district of the Barrier, must have told with fearful
severity upon the constitutions of those who had
been reared under the sunny skies of Italy and Spain.</p>

<div class='sidenote c001'>NUMISMATIC REMAINS.</div>

<p class='c000'>Next in importance to the inscribed stones found
on the line of the Wall, the student of history will
reckon the coins which the spade and plough of the
husbandman turn up in considerable numbers in the
mural region. In a rude state of society the commercial
transactions of the residents of a district are
almost entirely confined to an interchange of the
commodities produced by each. A body of soldiery,
however, liable to be removed from place to place, and
compelled to expend their energies in unproductive
industry, are necessarily obliged to resort to the use
of money. It is chiefly in the stations where the
Roman legions lodged, or on the roads which they
traversed, that the imperial coin is found. These
metallic pieces, bearing the insignia of Rome, thus
become exceedingly important in tracking the march
of Roman armies. As works of art, the design and
execution of many of them are truly admirable. The
copper coins of Hadrian are especially worthy of
study. The custom which prevailed during the best
periods of the empire, of rendering the circulating
medium of the market-place the means of commemorating
the leading events of the day, gives them
increased value. Were all the other records of
Roman story destroyed, its most stirring incidents
might be recovered by a careful examination of the
coins which the cabinets of the antiquary contain.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>COINS.</div>
<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>Ample use has already been made of this source of
information in the first Part of this work. Why is
it that Britain neglects this means of rousing the
spirit of her people, of communicating information,
and of securing an almost imperishable memorial of
her mighty acts? Had she recorded upon her
coinage the events of the last half-century, she would
have transmitted to posterity the memory of a series
of warlike achievements and peaceful triumphs unparalleled
in extent and unequalled in glory. As it
is, our metallic currency has little value beyond its
commercial worth, and generation after generation is
compelled to contemplate, with what complacency
they may, the same lady sitting immoveably upon
the same enduring rock, and the same mounted
knight making his interminable attempt to slay the
same deathless dragon. The immense number of
the coins found upon the line of the Wall, and the
extension of the series from the earliest periods down
to the time of Honorius, prove incontestibly the
length of time that the Romans maintained their
hold of this isthmus. The accidental loss of pieces
of money will not, alone, account for the large quantity
which has been found. In times of danger the
possessors of treasure seem to have been in the habit
of concealing it in the earth; the secret of their
having done so must often have perished with them.
In excavating that portion of the station of <span class='sc'>Cilurnum</span>
which was opened in 1843, not fewer than seventy
Roman coins were found. In 1833, near the west
gateway of <span class='sc'>Vindolana</span>, three hundred small brass
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>coins, mostly of Constantius and Mangentius, were
found, not in a heap or vessel, but dispersed among
the soil. The Rev. John Walton, who, about a century
ago was vicar of Corbridge, made a considerable
collection of Roman coins, by purchasing such as
were turned up in the neighbouring station of Corchester.
The following circumstance is related
concerning him. A party of Jews having established
in the neighbourhood a prussian-blue manufactory,
felt disposed to enter the market with the vicar. Mr.
Walton, unwilling to compete with them by offering
a larger price, had the fields where the coins were
found, strewed with imitations of the genuine pieces.
These, on being picked up, were freely bought by
the Jews, who, soon finding the trade a losing one,
abandoned it altogether.</p>

<p class='c000'>The station, notwithstanding such systematic
gleaning, is not yet deprived of its treasures. Not
long ago, a rustic eked out a livelihood by searching
for its coins, and disposing of them to occasional
customers. The other day a plough-boy being
asked if he had found any lately, produced straight-way
from his pocket not less than thirty, most of
them, indeed, highly corroded.</p>

<p class='c000'>The coinage of Rome seems to have continued in
circulation in the north of England for a very short
time after the departure of the Roman forces from
Britain. Saxon money is found in Northumberland
of a date coeval with the arrival of that people, but
is never mingled with the Roman coinage. The
coins of the Romans, on the other hand, are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>never accompanied by those of their successors.
Within about forty years after the departure of the
Romans, the circulation of the imperial coinage
seems to have ceased. This circumstance proves
incontestibly that a mighty political revolution had
taken place in the interval. The present appearance
of the stations corroborates the idea. The walls
have been forcibly thrown down, the statues and
other objects within them purposely mutilated, and
the whole inclosure rendered, as far as possible
unfit for human habitation.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THORNGRAFTON COINS.</div>

<p class='c000'>To attempt a description of even the principal
coins that can still be ascertained to have been procured
from the district of the Wall, would be to
compose a treatise upon numismatics. It will perhaps
be sufficient to lay before the reader a brief
<span id='p434' class='figright id045'><img src='images/i_p434.jpg' alt='Vessel, in which the Thorngrafton Coins were found' class='ig001' /></span>account of the hoard which was discovered in 1837,
in an ancient quarry near Thorngrafton. The coins,
sixty-five in number, were contained in a small
skiff-shaped receptacle with a circular handle. The
vessel represented in
the adjoining wood-cut
is about six inches
long; the lid has a
hinge at one end, and
fastens with a spring
at the other. The
coins are at present
in the possession of
the brother of the
quarryman who discovered them, and he holds them
with such tenacity, that my artist was refused permission
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>to see even the case which contained them,
though he had taken a journey of thirty miles for
the purpose of drawing them. Mr. Fairless, of
Hexham, was more fortunate, and obtained leave to
take sealing-wax impressions of the coins, from
which the wood-cuts have been prepared. I am
indebted to Mr. Fairless for the description of the
coins, which he took from the pieces themselves.</p>

<h3 class='c025'>MINERALS AND METALS.</h3>

<p class='c032'>In nearly all the stations of the line, the ashes of
mineral fuel have been found; in some, a store of
unconsumed coal has been met with, which, though
intended to give warmth to the primeval occupants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>of the isthmus, has been burnt in the grates of the
modern English. In several places the source
whence the mineral was procured can be pointed
out; but the most extensive workings that I have
heard of, are in the neighbourhood of Grindon
Lough, near Sewingshields. Not long ago, a shaft
was sunk, with the view of procuring the coal which
was supposed to be below the surface; the projector
soon found, that though coal had been there, it was
all removed. The ancient workings stretched
beneath the bed of the lake.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>MINING OPERATIONS.</div>

<p class='c000'>In Allendale and Alston Moor, numerous masses
of ancient scoriæ have been found, which must have
resulted from the reduction of lead from its ore. In
the station of Corchester, portions of lead pipe have
been found; it is an inch and a half in diameter,
and has been formed by bending round a flat strip
of the metal, and soldering the joint.</p>

<p class='c000'>Iron has been produced in large quantities. In
the neighbourhood of <span class='sc'>Habitancum</span> masses of iron
slag have been found. It is heavier than what proceeds
from modern furnaces, in consequence, probably,
of the imperfect reduction of the ore. In the
neighbourhood of Lanchester, the process seems to
have been carried on very extensively. On the
division of the common, two large heaps were
removed, the one containing about four hundred cart
loads of dross, the other six hundred. It was used
in the construction of some new roads which were
then formed, a purpose for which it was admirably
adapted. In the neighbourhood of one of these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>heaps of scoriæ, the iron tongs represented in Plate
XVII. fig. 8, so much resembling those at present
used by blacksmiths, were ploughed up. During
the operation of bringing this common into cultivation,
the method adopted by the Romans of producing
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>BLAST FURNACE.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the blast necessary to smelt the metal was
made apparent. Two tunnels had been formed in
the side of a hill; they were wide at one extremity,
but tapered off to a narrow bore at the other, where
they met in a point. The mouths of the channels
opened towards the west, from which quarter a
prevalent wind blows in this valley, and sometimes
with great violence. The blast received
by them would, when the wind was high, be poured
with considerable force and effect upon the smelting
furnaces at the extremity of the tunnels.</p>

<h3 class='c025'>METALLIC IMPLEMENTS.</h3>

<p class='c032'>Notwithstanding the tendency of iron to oxidize,
several weapons made of this material, and used by
the Romans, have come down to our day. Their
general character and form can be better learnt from
an inspection of the drawings which depict them
than by verbal description. On Plate X. are shewn
two spear or javelin heads, and on <a href='#p444f'>Plate XVII</a>. the
iron points of some arrows.</p>

<p class='c000'>Vessels of cast-metal, fitted for domestic use, are
occasionally met with. On <a href='#p444f'>Plate XVII</a>. fig. 2, is a
specimen of a pot or boiler, closely resembling those
in modern use; it was found in cutting the Newcastle
and Carlisle Railway, near Haydon Bridge.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>METALLIC IMPLEMENTS.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>Bronze vessels are occasionally found. The utensils
depicted on <a href='#p444d'>Plate XVI</a>. are of this metal. Fig. 1,
is a pan, evidently intended for culinary purposes.
The use of the other vessel, fig. 2, so nearly resembling
a modern coffee-pot, is not so apparent, though
several of this form have been found in the Roman
stations in the north of England. Is it a decanter—a
sort of wine flagon? Both of these vessels were
found on the line of the Wall, but at what point I
have been unable to learn.</p>

<p class='c000'>Near to Whitfield, were recently found three
camp-kettles, of peculiar make, which are now in
the Museum of Antiquities at Newcastle-upon-Tyne.
They are formed of bronze, but of exceedingly thin
metal; they have evidently seen much service, and
are patched in several places. Owing to the thinness
of the metal they would very readily feel the fire.
In Italy, where during a great part of the year a fire
is only lighted when indispensable, similar vessels
are still in use. These three vessels vary in size,
so as to allow of their being placed one within the
other. The smallest of them is shewn on Plate
XVII. fig. 3. The strainer, fig. 1, also of bronze,
and very finely and tastefully perforated, was found
with them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The boss of a shield, having something of the
appearance of the head of a snake, <a href='#p190b'>Plate VII</a>. fig.
2, is also of bronze. It is preserved at Chesters.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fibulæ or clasps, for fastening the loose robes worn
by the Romans, are, as may be supposed, of ordinary
occurrence. The one represented, of the full size,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span><a href='#p268a'>Plate XIV</a>. fig. 2, was found at Carvoran. It is
of bronze, and is of a form of which there are many
examples. The tongue is wanting, but the spiral
spring to which it was attached, and the groove
which caught it, are distinctly observed. The small
pair of bronze shears or scissors, which are shewn of
their full size, <a href='#p268a'>Plate XIV</a>. fig. 1, were also found at
Carvoran.</p>

<h3 class='c025'>EARTHENWARE AND MISCELLANEOUS ARTICLES.</h3>

<div class='sidenote c001'>ROMAN POTTERY.</div>

<p class='c000'>Few subjects possess more interest than the pottery
of the Romans. Whether we regard the shape
of the vessels, the beauty of their ornaments, or the
excellence of the material of which they are composed,
they are worthy of our admiration. Fortunately
for the present writer, so much has recently
been published upon the subject, as to justify him in
dismissing it with a brief notice.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the earthenware vessels found in the
mural region are some of coarse structure, such as
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>amphoræ</em></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>mortaria</em></span>, pans for common domestic purposes,
and some which have probably been intended
for exposure to the fire. The amphoræ are large
narrow-necked vessels, capable of containing several
gallons, and formed of red clay. In general, they
have been furnished with two handles, on one of
which the maker’s name is not unfrequently stamped.
They were used for holding wine. I am not aware
of any having been found on the line of the Wall,
in a state at all approaching to completeness.</p>

<p class='c000'>The mortars are strong shallow vessels, provided
<span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>with a lip for the convenience of pouring. They
are formed of clay, resembling fire-brick in colour.
On their inner surface, are frequently imbedded
angular fragments of quartz, chert, or iron scoriæ.
By this contrivance, the bruising of parched corn or
other articles of food would be more easily effected.</p>

<p class='c000'>Various vessels of common earthenware, such as
would be required in every household for holding
water, grain, and kindred substances, are discovered,
occasionally nearly perfect. At Nether Hall some
very fine ones are preserved, which were found in
the neighbouring station; one is twelve inches in
diameter, and nearly six deep. Another, of globular
form, is ten inches in diameter, and nine in depth.</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides these, fragments of thick vessels are frequently
met with, which are of a porous nature, and
hence well adapted to withstand the sudden application
of heat. In these, when placed upon the fire, we
may readily conceive that food was baked or stewed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Other vessels, for the most part of smaller size,
more elegant shape, and composed of finer materials,
are of common occurrence. Some are nearly
black, others grey or slate-coloured: these are quite
plain and unembossed. A species of yellow earthen-ware
is found, tinted with a brown pigment, by the
partial removal of which, a sort of pattern is given
to it. All these are of British manufacture. Many
of the potteries in which they were fabricated,
have been clearly ascertained. The slate-coloured
and grey kinds owe their peculiar hue to the action
of what has been called, the smother kiln. During
<span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>the process of baking the vessels, the vent of the
furnace has been closed, so as to fill the kiln with
smoke. The unconsumed carbon not only communicated
its own hue to the objects exposed to it, but
prevented the iron, which usually forms the colouring
matter of clay, from being converted into the peroxide,
which is of a brick-red colour.<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c012'><sup>[147]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>SAMIAN WARE.</div>

<p class='c000'>The finest species of earthenware found in
Roman camps, is that called Samian. It is of a
bright coral-red colour. It can at once be detected
by its glaze, which has not yet, in modern times,
been successfully imitated. Some vessels are quite
plain, but others are very tastefully embossed.
Plates IX. and XV. furnish specimens of the more
ornamental kind. The large fragment, engraved
<a href='#p444b'>Plate XV</a>. fig. 1, was found in sinking the shaft of
the famous Wallsend pit. No potteries for the
manufacture of this species of ware, have been found
in Britain; and as the maker’s marks, and the patterns
of the embossed varieties correspond with
those found on the continent, it is conceived to be
of foreign origin. Gaul and Spain have been pointed
out as the countries from which the specimens exhumed
in Britain were probably procured. The vast
quantity of fragments of Samian ware mingled
with the rubbish of some of the stations is truly
remarkable; and not less worthy of observation is
the fact, that not only has the clay of which the
broken vessels are composed, undergone no deterioration
by being buried for centuries in the damp
<span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>earth, but even the glaze is, to all appearance, uninjured.
That even the plainer kinds of Samian ware
have been accounted valuable by their owners, is
evident from the circumstance, that marks and names,
by which they might be identified, have in numerous
instances been scratched upon them. In <a href='#p170c'>Plate VII</a>.
figs. 9 and 11, are two examples of this kind, found
at <span class='sc'>Cilurnum</span>, and still preserved there. In some
cases where a vessel has been fractured, it has been
joined by clasps of lead. Fig. 1, <a href='#p190b'>Plate VII</a>., is an
example of this, also found at <span class='sc'>Cilurnum</span>. The process
of boring the holes to receive the lead must
have been one of some labour, and would not have
been undertaken unless the vessel had been accounted
valuable.</p>

<p class='c000'>An imitation of the Samian ware seems to have
been made in Britain during the continuance of the
Roman period. It is not equal to the original in
colour, texture, or design. Fig. 2, <a href='#p190d'>Plate IX</a>. differs
in appearance from true Samian—it may be an
imitation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The lamp shewn on <a href='#p268a'>Plate XIV</a>. fig. 4, is of red
earthenware, covered with a black pigment; it
proves the vast amount of skill and taste which the
Romans lavished even upon articles of minor importance.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>MINOR ANTIQUITIES.</div>

<p class='c000'>Mill-stones are among the most frequent of the
discoveries made in our Roman stations. Some,
found at <span class='sc'>Cilurnum</span>, are shewn in <a href='#p224f'>Plate XIII</a>. fig. 4.
They closely resemble the querns which were used
in Scotland and the rural districts of Northumberland,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>within a recent period. Many of the stones
consist of the mill-stone grit, basalt, or granite of
the district; others are formed of a species of lava
which is not procured in any locality nearer than
Rhine Prussia. The advantage of these foreign
stones is, that, though hard, they are porous, and,
as they wear away, still present a continuity of
sharp edges to the action of the grain.</p>

<p class='c000'>The process of grinding the corn by hand-mills
must have been a most tedious one. Probably a
large proportion of the grain consumed by the
soldiers of the Barrier was simply boiled, after
being slightly bruised in mortars.</p>

<div class='sidenote c015'>CONCLUSION.</div>
<p class='c000'>Here a period must be put to this account of the
Roman Wall and its antiquities. Many topics worthy
of fuller discussion have been but cursorily treated,
and some omitted altogether; but it is impossible, in
a work of this extent, to do full justice to a subject of
such magnitude; we content ourselves with imitating
the moderation of Hadrian, who, instead of grasping
at universal empire, sought only a dominion which
he might reasonably hope to maintain.</p>

<p class='c000'>Still, we may reckon on some advantage from the
brief communion we have held with the Mighty
among the Ancients. We can hardly tarry, even for
an hour, in association with the palmy days of the
Great Empire, without learning, on the one hand, to
emulate the virtues that adorned her prosperity, and

possession obtained by the Eternal City, of Albion’s rocky shore.
However this may be, the same figure has been placed by many
successive generations of mint-masters on the reverse of the copper
coinage of Great Britain. Britain in this still bows to Rome!</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f8'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r8'>8</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Historians differ as to the degree of credibility due to this author.
Mr. Wright, in his Biographia Britannica Literaria, says that his
is ‘a name of very doubtful authority.’ Sharon Turner thinks
that ‘as far as he can be supported, and made intelligible, by
others, he is an acceptable companion, but that he cannot be
trusted alone;’ and Mr. Stevenson, in the preface to his edition of
the original Latin of Gildas, writes ‘We are unable to speak with
certainty as to his parentage, his country, or even his name, the
period when he lived, or the works of which he was the author.’
Thus much, however, is certain, that he lived before the time of
Bede, and is quoted by him.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f9'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r9'>9</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This point is well put by Sir Francis Palgrave, in his History
of the Anglo-Saxons. ‘The walls of the cities fortified by the
Romans were yet strong and firm. The tactics of the legions
were not forgotten. Bright armour was piled in the storehouses,
and the serried line of spears might have been presented to the
half-naked Scots and Picts, who could never have prevailed against
their opponents.’</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f10'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r10'>10</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The supposition is not destitute of support. The migratory
tendencies of the Gothic tribes have always been conspicuous.
From the earliest periods of our history, the inhabitants of Jutland
and its neighbouring provinces were in the habit of making
descents upon the coasts of Britain. After the departure of the
Romans, their attempts were probably more bold and frequent,
but they did not then, for the first time, commence. The Norfolk
and Suffolk coast was, from its position, peculiarly exposed to these
incursions, and as early as the close of the third century, was
placed under the command of a military Count called <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Comes litoris
Saxonici</em></span>. This district was called ‘the Saxon shore,’ as Sir Francis
Palgrave observes, not merely because it was open to the incursion
of the Saxons, but, most probably, because they had succeeded in
fixing themselves in some portion of it. The weak hold which the
Romans, at all times, had of Scotland, would render it an easier
prey than England to the Franks and Saxons. Tacitus informs
us, that the ruddy hair and lusty limbs of the Caledonians indicate
a Germanic extraction. Richard of Cirencester tells us, that a
little before the coming of Severus, the Picts landed in Scotland;
from which we are at least entitled to infer, that the Picts were
not the original inhabitants of North Britain; and probably the
statement is substantially correct, inasmuch as large reinforcements
landed in Scotland at this period, as previously observed.
The Scots—the other branch of the people classed under the general
term Caledonians—are confessedly of Irish origin. When St.
Columba, whose mother tongue was Irish Gaelic, preached to the
Picts, he used an interpreter. Fordun, the Father of Scottish
History, tells us, ‘The manners of the Scots are various as to
their languages; for they use two tongues, the Scottish and the
Teutonic. The last is spoken by those on the sea-coasts and in
the low countries, while the Scottish is the speech of the mountaineers
and the remote islanders.’ The proper Scots, Camden
describes as those commonly called Highlandmen; ‘for the
rest,’ he adds, ‘more civilized, and inhabiting the eastern part,
though comprehended under the name of Scots, are the farthest
in the world from being Scots, but are of the same German
origin with us English.’ Dr. Jamieson, whose researches in
philology are well known, is decidedly of opinion that the Picts
and Saxons had a common origin. Upon what other theory,
he argues, can the prevalence of the Saxon tongue in the Lowlands
of Scotland be accounted for? William the Conqueror could
not change the language of South Britain—was it likely that a few
Saxon fugitives at the Scottish court could supplant that of their
benefactors?</p>

<p class='c000'>The theory of the Germanic origin of the Picts removes another
difficulty. How is the disappearance of the Celtic tongue from
England to be accounted for? The Saxons, on seizing the soil,
would not exterminate the inhabitants, but retain them as bondsmen.
Had the majority of the occupants of England been the
original Britons or Romanized Celts, we should have found in our
daily speech, and in the names of our towns and villages, a large
intermixture of Gaelic and Latin; but such is not the case. Grant
that the Picts were a branch of the great Gothic family—and that
successive waves of them had, long before the time of Cerdic,
poured from the lowlands of Scotland over the plains of England,
and the almost entire extermination of the ancient British
is easily accounted for.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the theory here advocated, cannot be sustained, it must at least
be allowed, that the population of North Britain was largely
leavened with individuals of the Saxon race. These strangers
would doubtless obtain that supremacy over the natives which the
Franks did in Gaul; so that, even upon this limited view of the
question, the influence of the Germanic race in fixing the destinies
of Britain, at this critical period, is apparent.</p>

of national economy.</p>

up some portions of the Vallum in the neighbourhood of Wallend,
Cumberland, and who was also acquainted with the mode
in which the Maiden-way (a Roman road) was formed, I was
told that there were no traces of pavement in the Vallum.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r38'>38</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We must not, however, pronounce a road to be impracticable,
because now it would be thought so. A Northumberland farmer,
speaking to me upon this subject, said he had seen roads which,
in his neighbourhood, were regularly traversed only a century ago,
on which no one would venture now-a-days; ‘it was like
coming down a crag-side.’ He had driven through mosses in
which the horses were commonly enveloped, but had no misgivings
so long as he could see the heads of the animals.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r39'>39</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Hodgson, however, distinctly proves, that the <em>cornage</em>, or
castle-guard rent of the North of England—originally a payment

cattle-tax, or ox-lay—has nothing whatever to do with sounding

twenty degrees, caused apparently by the settling of the ponderous

of the supposition that the Wall was surmounted with a parapet on
its north side. The foundation would have settled equally if both
sides had been burdened alike.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r49'>49</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In some parts of the line, the joints of the Wall are at present
filled with earthy matter instead of mortar, and it is the opinion of
some authorities, and amongst them, the eminent architect and
intelligent antiquary, Mr. Dobson, of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, that
in these places, clay has been originally substituted for mortar.
Very loath to suppose that the original builders of the Wall
would leave any portion of it in so unsatisfactory a state, I
have been in the habit of accounting for the apparent absence of
mortar in the following way:—The upper part of the structure
having been overthrown by a ruthless enemy, and the lower
parts covered with the fallen rubbish, the whole heap would
speedily become coated with vegetation. Roman mortar, with all
its tenacity, would not be able to resist the powers of vitality; and
the constant demands of the ferns and the foxgloves would, in the
course of time, abstract the whole of the lime. The roots of the
plants, by whose agency the work of abstraction had proceeded,
yielding in due time to the process of decay, would themselves,
in the form of vegetable earth, supply the place of the lime which
they had withdrawn.</p>

fail to accompany the author, while he attempts, at the very commencement
of his local peregrination, to pay a tribute of respect
to three departed worthies who made the Wall their especial study.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>John Horsley</span> was the first and mightiest of the three—is it too
much to say that he was the father of the science of Archæology?
Born in an unknown locality of this county, receiving his elementary
education at Newcastle, his academical at Edinburgh, he
spent the greater portion of his life as the pastor of a Presbyterian
congregation in Morpeth. His tastes, and great familiarity with
the classics, induced him to devote his leisure hours to the study of
the antiquities of Northumberland. Had he conceived that the
Britannia Romana would have cost him one-third of the time
which its execution required, the world would never have seen it.
Having embarked in the undertaking, he felt it his duty to make
it as good as he could. How severe his toils, how great his pecuniary
sacrifices, how ardent his aspirations after emancipation from
his self-imposed task, in order that he might entirely devote himself
to his sacred calling, who shall tell? The thought that his flock might
eventually be no losers, that his family and his own fair fame might
gain by the enterprise, buoyed him up in his course. On 2 Jan.
1731-2, he put the finishing stroke to his labours, the dedication of
his work bearing that date. Now he might hope to reap the fruits
of his toils—the enjoyment of rest, such as the wearied only know,
the congratulations of friends, the approbation of the learned, the
replenishment of his exhausted means. None of these fruits he
enjoyed. He can scarcely have had the satisfaction of casting his
eyes upon a completed copy of his work. The ink of his dedication
was hardly dry when he was summoned to the unseen world.
Respecting him who recorded the mighty doings of the Romans in
Britain, the parish clerk of Morpeth made the following entry in
the church-yard calendar:—Buried,</p>
<div class='c013'>‘<em>1731-2, Jan. 15</em>, Mr. John Horsley.’</div>

<p class='c000'>‘Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.’ As regards the honours or
enjoyments of this world, he died an utterly unrequited man.
Even of that bubble, posthumous fame, an attempt was made to
rob him. Warburton, in his Vallum Romanum, transfers Horsley
‘in bulk’ to his pages—he even copies, without alteration, the
opinions which Horsley expresses in the first person. The honest
Hutton often quotes the ‘judicious Warburton,’ little knowing
whose the feathers are which he so justly admires. The precise spot
where his remains rest is unknown. He whose lot it was to interpret,
after the lapse of many centuries, the throbbings of natural
affection over departed relatives in the heathen breast, had no
one to erect over him, though a Christian minister, a memorial
that should outlive a single century. Even the parish clerk, in
his attachment to the altar and the throne, denies him, in the
sepulchral register, the title which courtesy, at least, would
have accorded him. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Requiescat in pace!</em></span></p>

<p class='c004'>The Rev. <span class='sc'>Anthony Hedley</span>, was also a native of Northumberland;
he was a man of literary tastes, and considerable antiquarian
acquirements. He entered public life as curate of Hexham, where
his preaching was that of a Boanerges. He subsequently held
some temporary appointments at Whelpington, Newcastle, and
Whitfield. Having, however, actively espoused the cause of that
political body, who, until lord Grey became premier, had no
patronage to bestow, it was his lot to sigh in vain for a summons
to active occupation in the work which he loved. When the
party whom he had long and conscientiously served, came into office,
neglect was his portion. One of the original members of the
Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, he did much to
promote the study of primæval archæology in the fruitful region
traversed by the Wall. Biased by his taste for antiquities, he was
led to select, as his abode for life’s evening, the beautiful valley
of the Chineley Burn. The rural hall arose at his bidding, nearly
every stone of which was chiseled by Roman hands. The milliary
which told to Hadrian’s soldiers that another mile had been
traversed, stood by his barn. The station of <span class='sc'>Vindolana</span> was in
his grounds—many beautiful altars and other important reliques
had he dug out of it—he could tell where the prætorium stood,
where the standards were deposited, where every soldier slept.
Scarcely were all the arrangements for his comfortable residence
at Chesterholm made, when death seized him as its victim. Imprudently
superintending, whilst somewhat indisposed, the exhumation
of an urn in the station, his mortal part was a few days
afterwards deposited in the church-yard at Beltingham. He died
in 1835, and his beautiful abode has since remained desolate.</p>

<p class='c004'>Westmoreland has the honour of giving birth to the Rev. <span class='sc'>John
Hodgson</span>, but Northumberland enjoyed the advantage of his
youthful and maturer labours. Successively curate of Sedgefield,
Lanchester, and Heworth, and afterwards vicar of Kirkwhelpington,
he was shortly before his death promoted to the living of Hartburn.
He was the chief founder of the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle-upon-Tyne,
and the chief contributor to its transactions.
His tastes led him to contemplate, and an honourable desire to
make provision for the education and settlement of his family, induced
him to begin, a history of Northumberland. Seldom have
laudable designs been so signally defeated. He lived but to complete
a part of his task; his health failed, and his mind gave way
under his excessive labours. His fortunes were not bettered by
them; ‘I have lived,’ said he, 'to see that works of this kind are
not suited to the times I live in, perhaps to any time. It is not
profitable to me—it is not suited to my profession—I ought to do
my duty in my profession—to take up night and day to do it well.
Well? no; but as well as good intentions, holy zeal, every
thought and faculty of my mind fully exerted, could do it.' Hodgson
paid great attention to the Wall, and its antiquities. The last
published portion of his history contains a vast mass of learned
information upon the subject. It is perhaps enough for the present
author to say, that had not Horsley and Hodgson cleared the way
before him, he would never have adventured to write a book upon
the Barrier of the Lower Isthmus. Though he cannot be a Horsley
or a Hodgson, he hopes he will never prove a Warburton.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f55'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r55'>55</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Brand conceives that <span class='sc'>Segedunum</span> may be derived from
the Saxon <em>secg</em>, a sedge or flag, and <em>dun</em>, which is an Anglo-Saxon,
as well as a Celtic word; this would give, as its meaning—the hill of
sedge. If we can suppose that any of the Germanic hordes had
obtained so complete a settlement here, as to give them the power
of forming a local vocabulary in accordance with their own language
prior to the Roman occupation of this post, the Saxon origin
of the term is by no means improbable. In no part of England
was an early settlement more likely to take place than on the
eastern coast of Northumberland, but, after all, we must probably
assign a later date to the first arrival of our Gothic forefathers.
If a Saxon derivation be at all admissible, another might be suggested:
<em>sige</em> is the Anglo-Saxon for victory, and <em>tun</em> is town—the
town of victory—an appropriate name for a station occupied either
by Roman or Saxon forces.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f56'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r56'>56</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This statement I make on the authority of the late Mr. Buddle,

extending far into the river.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f57'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r57'>57</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This place derived its earlier name from being the property,
and perhaps the suburban residence of John Cosyn, a worthy
alderman of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, in the seventeenth century.
About 1740, sir Robert Carre, a London knight, and draper,
but also, it is thought, a burgess of the northern metropolis,
bought Cosyn’s house at Wallsend, and thenceforward designated
it Carre-ville. The present mansion is, with some little impropriety,
called Carville-<em>hall</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>When I began my inquiries at Wallsend, I had much difficulty
in ascertaining which was Cousin’s-house. One man told me he
had lived all his life in Wallsend—sixty years—and had never
heard of it. Our books still continue to copy from Horsley, and
to give us the out-of-date information that the Wall began at
Cousin’s-house.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r58'>58</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In districts where the Wall has been levelled with the earth, a
foot-path or bridle-road frequently indicates its course. When
land was of less value than it is now, the farmers, who appropriated
the stones of the Wall to their own use, were not at the trouble to
remove its foundation. The stony track, however, afforded a firm
road, and when the increased value of the ground rendered it worth
while to bring the whole into cultivation, a right of way had, in
many instances, been established.</p>

wall, but the great Wall itself. If, as the excavations made
since Horsley’s day seem to prove, the Wall crossed obliquely from
the south to the north side of Collingwood-street, it must have
passed over the site of St. Nicholas’-church—not to the north of it.</p>

of Pen or Ben; the village of Benwell is below it.</p>

I am now prepared to receive the statement without deduction.
Some recent excavations at Risingham have laid bare a part of
the curtain wall which has been built double, the intervening space,
or chamber, being filled up with rubble and rubbish run together
with lime, so as to form a solid mass of masonry of considerable
thickness. The object of this arrangement may have been, to form

iron would give the instrument tenacity, and the lead protect the
more corrosive metal from oxidization; truly the Romans built
for perpetuity.</p>

placed at the entrance of the flue, would effectually warm the whole.
Specimens of bricks of this kind, remarkably strong, and ingeniously

whose design they were formed. The Latin comedy represents the

became wastes. The forests being partially destroyed, either by
fire or the axe, the streams which used to permeate the low-grounds
were arrested in their course by prostrate trunks and
branches, and gave rise to extensive morasses. In the bogs of
the district we are now considering, immense quantities of large
oak and birch timber, as well as of oak leaves and hazel nuts, are
continually being found. The Dike would not, of course, originally,
be drawn through swampy ground.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r101'>101</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Horsley remarks, 'I cannot say that Hadrian’s Vallum has
made the south rampart of this station at Housesteads, but I think
it has passed it not much to the south, and seems to have a small
turn just at the brook, in order to come near, if not up to it.' This
looks as if Horsley could not altogether throw off the idea that
the works exhibit unity of design. Hutton notices his inconsistency,
and, quoting him, (as transferred to the pages of ‘the judicious
Warburton,’) writes—‘But can a thing be brought near to
what does not exist! Hadrian was dead long before the appearance
of this station.’</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r113'>113</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A dilapidated building, near the east end of the town, illustrates
some of the peculiarities of this species of border fortress. The
lower portion of it was devoted to the reception of cattle—the
upper was occupied by the family. The floor of the second story
consists of stone flags laid upon massive beams of oak, very roughly
dressed. The object of this arrangement has probably been to
prevent the enemy, who might get possession of the lower part of
the building without being able to take the upper part by storm,
from applying, with much success at least, fire to the floor. The
stone slates of the roof were generally fastened with the bones of
sheeps’ trotters—a most durable fastening—instead of wooden pins;
but, in this instance, the original roof has been removed.</p>

of Christ’s blessed gospel, according to the duty of that office and
ministry whereunto among you I was chosen, named, and appointed,
by the mouth of that our late peerless prince, king Edward.'
In a letter, in which, as one ‘minding to take a far journey,’
he bids farewell to his loving brothers and sisters, and his well-beloved
and worshipful cousins, he specifies many of the well-known

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f122'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r122'>122</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I have been strongly reminded of these circular pedestals by
the figures of the columns of the Roman part of Reculver church,
given (p. 198) in Mr. C. Roach Smith’s admirable work on Richborough
and Reculver. The northern examples are, however, of
coarser workmanship than the southern seem to have been; the
moulding that encircles the Carvoran specimen resembles straw-ropes
rather than carefully fabricated cables.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f123'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r123'>123</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Thirl, from the Saxon <i>thirlian</i>, signifies to pierce, to bore. It
is generally supposed, that this stronghold derived its name from
the Scots having broken through the Wall here. It may, however,
have taken it from the sluice or bridge where the river passed
through the Wall; thirl, says Hutchinson, being frequently
applied to the opening left in moor fences for sheep to pass through.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f124'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r124'>124</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Can it have been derived from the Saxon <i>bryddes wald</i> or
<i>weald</i>, the bird’s forest? The local pronunciation of the name of
the place is peculiar and rather favours the proposed etymology.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f125'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r125'>125</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Wall is at too great a distance from the Vallum to be
introduced into the section; it is beyond the extra fosse, on the
right hand side of the wood-cut.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f126'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r126'>126</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In this locality, the traveller is apt to lose his reckoning, in
consequence of the number of cottages and villages which are denominated
‘Wall.’</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f127'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r127'>127</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Some antiquaries have conceived, that in the last two words
of the inscription, a reference is made to the emperor Septimius
Severus. This cannot be admitted, for—1. The emperor’s name
would not be placed after that of the prefect: 2. The term <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>instante</em></span>
implies the discharge of a subordinate duty; for, not to mention
other examples, the temple of which the <span class='sc'>Cilurnum</span> slab records
the restoration (p. 186), was built by command of Marius Valerianus,
under the superintendence of (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>instante</em></span>) Septimius Nilus:
3. That <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>princeps</em></span> was the designation of a subordinate officer in
the army, appears not only from a collation of other inscriptions,
but from the following statement of Manutius—'In a legion there
were three kinds of foot soldiers, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>hastati</em></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>principes</em></span>, and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>triarii</em></span>, and in
each there were ten centurions, who were called the first <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>hastatus</em></span>,
the second <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>hastatus</em></span>, the third, and so on, up to the tenth; the first
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>princeps</em></span>, the second, and so on; but the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>triarii</em></span>, the bravest of all,
were named in a different manner, for they did not call them first
triarius, but <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>primipilus</em></span>, or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>primipili centurio</em></span>.'—<cite>Arch. Æl.</cite>, ii. 88.</p>

<p class='c000'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Principi</em></span> is doubtless intended for the more usual form of the
ablative, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>principe</em></span>.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f128'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r128'>128</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>An earthen encampment is cut in two by the Newcastle and
Berwick railway, in the second field south of the Netherton
station. In the space of three fields, lying east of this camp,
three others may be distinctly discerned, varying in size from forty
to seventy yards square. At Dove-cote, which is less than a mile
west of Netherton station, is a large field covered with the ruins of
stone buildings. Excavations in one portion at least of the ground
yield large quantities of glazed pottery. The remains are apparently
mediæval, but it is remarkable that no record of ruins so
extensive is known to exist.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f129'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r129'>129</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Hutchinson says (A.D. 1778), the altar to Hercules is in
the possession of the duke of Northumberland; it is not now
among those preserved at Alnwick-castle. The altar to Astarte is
in the collection at Netherby.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f130'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r130'>130</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The last time I was in the crypt, I was impressed with the idea
that some portions of it were actually of Roman workmanship;
if so, St. Wilfrid has adapted to his own uses the vaults which he
found on the spot. The crypt at Ripon, to which this bears a
marked resemblance, is now understood to be Roman.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f131'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r131'>131</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Horsley, near the close of his work, was less opposed to this
view than at the beginning. In a note (<em>p.</em> 481), he says—‘I see
no reason to change my sentiments concerning any one of these
stations; except that I am more inclined to yield to the common
opinion, that <span class='sc'>Bremetenracum</span> is at Brampton, and to think that
<span class='sc'>Olenacum</span> and <span class='sc'>Virosidum</span> are transposed; so that <span class='sc'>Olenacum</span>
may be Ellenborough, on the river Ellen, and <span class='sc'>Virosidum</span>,
Old Carlisle, on the Wiza. And if the military-way near
the Wall, which goes by Watchcross, has led to Brampton, as the
country people suppose, this might still make it more probable, that
Brampton is <span class='sc'>Bremetenracum</span>.’</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
